              Let’s get this thing started in the right place. There are two
              kinds of talk you engage in every day: talking to others and
              talking to yourself. You might be one of those that insists, “I
              don’t talk to myself!” But, in fact, most of the conversations you
              have on any given day are with yourself—all “enjoyed” in the
              solitude and privacy of your own head.

              Studies show that we have over fifty thousand thoughts per day.
              Think of all the things you say to yourself that you’d rather not
              or that you try to overcome or defeat. While we have little or no
              say in those automatic and reactionary thoughts, we have a massive
              say in which of those same thoughts we attach significance to.

              The latest in neuroscience and psychology adds weight to the idea
              that the <i>kind </i>of talk you engage in has a profound impact
              on the quality of your life. Professor Will Hart of the University
              of Alabama conducted four experiments in which participants either
              recalled or experienced a positive, negative or neutral event.

              They found that people who described the neutral event in ways
              that it suggested it was ongoing, actually felt more positive and
              when they described a negative event in the same way, they
              experienced more negativity. In simple terms, the language you use
              to describe your circumstances determines how you see, experience
              and participate in them and dramatically affect how you deal with
              your life and confront problems both big and small.

              The connection between what we say and how we feel has been known
              for hundreds if not thousands of years. Philosophers like
              Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Gadamer all knew of the importance and
              significance of language in our lives. Wittgenstein said, “…the
              harmony between thought and reality can be found the grammar of
              the language”.

              The good news is, studies have continually found that positive
              self-talk can dramatically improve mood, boost confidence,
              increase productivity, and more. Much more. In fact, as evidenced
              by Professor Hart and his studies, it can be one of the key
              components to a happy, successful life.

              The bad news is, the reverse is also true: Negative self-talk can
              not only put us in a bad mood, it can leave us feeling helpless.
              It can make small problems seem bigger – and even create problems
              where none existed before. Here’s the breaking news, your
              self-talk is fucking you over and in ways you can’t even begin to

              With all of this in mind, let’s get one thing clear: Even though
              this is a book about using the right language to improve your

              personal affirmations. Those subjects have been done to death with

              That quote comes from Albert Ellis, one of the forefathers of
              modern psychology. Ellis found that how we think and talk about
              our experiences shifts the way we feel about them. In short, our
              thoughts are bedfellows with our emotions.

              You see, it’s not always dramatic self-talk, sometimes it’s subtle
              but equally disempowering. If you’re working on something, you
              might think,
              <i><b>“This is so hard. What if I don’t finish in time?” </b></i

              you tell yourself how hard something is, the harder it will
              actually seem. Unfortunately, since we are constantly listening to

              Scientists have discovered that our thoughts can actually change
              the physical structure of our brain. This phenomenon,
              neuroplasticity, is revolutionizing the way we think about the
              human mind.

              As we go through life learning and experiencing new things, our
              brain is constantly arranging and rearranging the neural pathways
              that control how we think and behave. The best part is, we direct
              our thoughts in a way that consciously modifies these path ways
              for ourselves. And the easiest way to shape those thoughts is
              through conscious, decisive self-talk. The kind of talk that “cuts
              through” and takes control of your life.

              Just like we build habits by repeating an action until it becomes
              “automatic”, we can use strong, assertive language over time to
              create lasting change in our lives. It’s more than just happy

              It all starts by making a conscious choice to talk in a way that’s
              helpful rather than harmful. By using the right kind of language
              and framing our problems in a more readily accessible light, we
              can quite literally change the way we see and interact with the
              world. All that stuff you’ve heard and read about, “creating your
              own reality”? It’s not only possible but millions of people the
              world over are already doing it! And the best part is, they’re not
              only creating it, they are in fact acting on it and living it.

              How we talk, think about, and therefore perceive our surroundings
              is the very foundation for our reality. Create the reality you
              want to live in by beginning the process of having the kind of

              these pages. You cannot, I repeat CANNOT dwell in any blame game
              in your life. Even blaming yourself is completely useless. Of
              course you’ll face situations that you seemingly can’t control.

              Believe me, I hear you, “I am willing but...”. Every time you add
              the “but” to the end of that statement, you turn yourself into the
              victim. In my many years as a coach and mentor, I have heard as
              many complex life situations as there are, from the darkest of
              pasts to the weight and gravity of the present or crippling fear
              of the future, I have heard them over and over and over again. You
              have to hear what I am saying in the way that it’s intended. I’m
              not saying these things to inflame you, well, maybe I am but the
              intention is to inflame you to your own potential, to realize your
              own greatness, not just to piss you off! Take the case, imagine
              for a moment, that willingness is missing in your life. Not some
              wispy, sheepish willingness but rather a bold willingness, the
              kind of willing state where you are ready for what’s next and
              ready to act on it. Willingness to change, willingness to let go,
              willingness to accept. Real, magical, inspired willingness.

              Before you can say that to yourself honestly, you must first ask
              yourself the question is, “Am I willing?” That question demands an

              We often view ourselves as procrastinators or lazy or unmotivated.
              When in reality, we’re simply unwilling. We put things off or
              avoid them completely because we tell ourselves we just don’t want
              to do it or that we <i>can’t </i>do it.

              Instead of viewing this behavior as a character flaw, let’s create
              a sense of willingness where there is apparently none. A spark of
              potential, if you like. You are a master generator of this state
              of openness and potential. Once upon a time in your life, this

              curiosity of childhood. Somehow, over the years, we lost touch

              That’s actually okay. Getting straight with yourself about having
              made the decision to stay where you are can be just as powerful as
              the decision to move. Why? Because sometimes recognizing that you
              willingly put yourself in a place where you are unhappy is often
              all the impetus required to make an opening for real and lasting
              change. This has to be done without blaming yourself and turning
              yourself into a victim of some internal blip or character “flaw”.
              In the moment you realize you have cognitively and systematically
              put yourself here, guess what? That’s right, you can cognitively
              and systematically get yourself out! This is also the foundation
              of granting yourself the grace of acceptance, of embracing what
              has been and daring yourself to reach for an unimaginable future.

              By stating and facing your unwillingness to change, you can take
              stock of yourself and your life and begin to create a sliver of
              light for you to at least start. The secret is, once you’ve
              separated the task (or whatever it is you are dealing with), from
              the drama of the past, you may find yourself more open to tackling
              it. You’ll be able to get past the emotional swirl and straight to
              the heart of the issue itself.

              What if you are actually driven to prove the notion that no one
              will ever love you? What if it was planted there as a subconscious
              reaction to a turbulent childhood, bad breakups, or the like? And

              You became sensitive to problems where there were apparently none.
              You started picking at, getting annoyed by and blowing up the

              relationship reached its obvious, final and natural conclusion.

              Believe it or not, it’s not necessarily any harder to make $60k
              than it is $30k. You may think it is, but that’s not an absolute.
              Whether you work for $25/hour or $50/hour, 40 hours of work is
              still 40 hours of actual work. While it’s important to identify
              what you’re at work on and whether you are being productive
              instead of just busy, sometimes it really is a question of getting
              yourself into another domain. How does one do that? Firstly, you
              have to uncover and realize the ways in which you have limited
              yourself. The kind of, “absolutes”, that you are currently unaware
              of. In short, the conclusions that you have come to about
              yourself, others and life itself. Those conclusions are the limit
              of your potential. It’s only when you have broken through those
              conclusions and can experience a life outside of your current
              existence that you start to understand the power of this
              phenomenon.

              Many of my clients, I have found, have one particular thing in
              common: the subconscious desire to prove that their parents did a
              bad job raising them. This can manifest in so many different ways,
              some being worse than others. Some are subtle, others obvious,
              while all are very potent.

              You might try to prove that your parents failed to raise you well
              by treating your body like crap, getting arrested, becoming
              addicted to drugs or alcohol, dropping out of school, consistently
              failing in relationships, chronic financial crises or any one of a
              number of seemingly random paths we get ourselves lost in. They
              can drop all the way down to simply being disconnected or lost in
              the pressures of work as an adult.

              All of these are real-life examples that some of my clients
              discovered about themselves that ultimately “proved” that one or
              both of their parents failed to do their job, that their
              experiences as children did not adequately prepare them for
              adulthood. This belief, conveniently, also allows for a ready-made

              Don’t stop there. Consider the changes in mindset you’ll need to
              make during and after your quest to become more fit. You have to
              be relentless in the pursuit of your goal, particularly when those

              Once you’ve faced your problems head on, how will your sense of
              self change? When you’re the fit and healthy person you want to
              be, how will your beliefs about yourself be different? What will
              <i>that </i>life look like? I would warn against the idea that

              But that mindset shift is exactly what creates the environment for
              our ultimate undoing. When we’re no longer uncertain about money,
              the desire—the need even—to pursue it recedes. When we’re no

              We get to wallow in our bloated illusion of certainty. Eventually

              When you stop searching for certainty, when you quit trying to
              make sense of everything, a lot of your stress will simply melt
              away. There really is nothing to figure out. If you took the time
              to be with what I’m saying, you’d realize that what causes most of
              your worry is trying to predict the future and then refusing to
              accept things when they don’t or aren’t going to go your way.

              There are a couple reasons for this. We know your thoughts can
              become your reality. And when your reality is one of acting on the
              things that are in your best interests, your thoughts will
              actually shift to match that. Think about this: your thoughts (and
              the resulting feelings) are not always aligned with what is in the
              best interests of your life, your health, your finances or your
              potential. Many times those same thoughts and feelings are pulling
              you away from your potential. Things like doubt, fear,
              procrastination or frustration rule the day instead of the kind of
              positive action that will actually forward your life.

              This method is actually similar to one used by psychiatrists
              giving therapy to their patients. That’s because it works. By
              challenging our thoughts with actions and exposing ourselves to
              the situations we resist, we train our brain to see the world more
              cognitively. We get accustomed to living life, “as is” rather than

              I like what Dale says here. When we choose action instead of
              inaction, when we act beyond our automatic thoughts, something
              interesting happens: we start to forget about the things that are
              bothering us.

              successes are so rare. Because most people don’t like being

              They’ll say you can’t do it, you’re making a mistake, it’s
              impossible, you’ll fail. The more unique and out-of-the-box your

              I think it goes out further, much further. I say the problem is
              expectation itself. I contend that the upsets strewn throughout
              your entire life are a product of thousands of unspoken or
              unrecognized expectations that cast a giant shadow across your
              life experience; causing great stress when you’re trying to make
              life fit with your expectations and great disappointment when life
              doesn’t match up to them.

              <i><b>real </b></i>lives<i>, </i>our real issues and items that

              by understanding how your mind works, seeing what it’s doing as it

              SO WHAT!!!!????? Before you jump furiously on the offended bus,
              why is it you show more passion for your past than you do your
              future? You and I both know no one can free you but you. I’m not
              just another guy in the diner with an opinion, I’ve coached people
              with pasts that would make your toes curl. They have gone on to
              live free and happy lives and you can too.

              People become trapped in their past, trapped in their childhood.
              It’s one of the many reasons we tell ourselves that we “can’t”.
              It’s an easy way to relieve yourself of the responsibility you
              have for your current circumstances.

              These two steps, stopping and starting, are naturally linked.
              Because psychologically, it’s hard to just quit something “cold
              turkey”. Especially when it’s an addictive habit, that affects the
              very chemistry of our brains, like food or sex or drugs or video

              Stopping your bad habit doesn’t help, unless you replace it with
              something else, something that actually works in your favor and is
              an example of the new kind of life you really want to live. It’s
              about systematically replacing the old with the new, forging a new

        Alcohol – the coward's way of dealing with life <br />
        10 Things About Addiction <br />
        <br />
        1. Addiction acts to decorate an empty life. <br />
        <br />
        2. Addiction acts to avoid the pain necessary to take our proper rite of
        passage from child to adult, inside the tribal circle. <br />
        <br />
        3. Addiction is how we avoid what we need to grow, evolve and become our
        best self. <br />
        4. Addiction invites losers into your life because you have no morals or
        standards.<br />

        5. Addiction traps our traumas inside of us, in order that we live them
        out over and over again. We need to feel our pain for the traumas to
        dissolve and leave our system. Addiction blocks pain and therefore
        blocks our healing. <br />
        <br />
        6. Addiction keeps us disconnected from whom we are and why we're here.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. Addiction makes us dependent on others. Addiction steals the energy
        of others, energy that isn't the property of the addict to take.
        Addiction makes us a perpetual infant, bleeding the tribe of the energy
        it needs to prosper. <br />
        <br />
        8. Addiction keeps us focused on things that don't matter today, that
        have never mattered and that will never matter in the future. <br />
        <br />
        9. Addiction is the act of destroying oneself in an attempt to ease the
        pain of never loving oneself enough, to stop destroying oneself. <br />
        <br />
        10. Addiction is about interfacing with the world as a child, too afraid
        and not confident enough to feel the pain of this world. Addiction traps
        us away from ever feeling the love in the world as well. Addiction
        blocks feeling and that includes all feelings.........even joy, love,
        excitement, satisfaction and personal growth. Not feeling is a coward's
        way of walking the earth. You've never felt real joy or real love if
        you're addicted. When you're addicted, you only feel fake feel-good
        chemical simulations...of real emotions <br />
        <br />
        You've got Money in the bank, a car, all your limbs, a roof over your
        head, get a few looks off chicks when you’re not a complete derro and
        you’re bitching? thinking you have it tough when in reality, you’re just
        a lazy cunt that’s had it to easy and now you have to work for what you
        want, you’re sulking? You’re fucking lucky you’re not doing 6-12 months
        at Silverwater and Mum and BJ haven’t kicked you out... It’s funny,
        you’ve never had it tough and look at what’s happened? You got called
        out to man-up and cried for 3 months? Still crying How are the disabled
        people you see every day? You cannot be fucking serious You need to step
        up and fix your life instead of being a miserable alcoholic man-child
        Drinking all day in Coles Carpark or $8 drinks at the Timo, gay shit The
        reality of being a man Don’t let this happen when it’s too late “What's
        the easiest and best way to fix my life? <br /><br />Do the exact
        opposite of what I'm doing now” <br /><br />There're millions of cunts
        that have it 10 times worse than you Adrian not getting trashed every
        day... Stop living 1 day at a time Kelly Kinross, stop crying over a
        slut, get the fuck on with it, business before pleasure
        <br /><br />You’re the type of cunt now that 95% of women hate, you
        wonder why you’re single? weak derro mummy’s boy and you’re paying for
        it, every time you have even the smallest issue in your life you need to
        get trashed for days?... harden up cunt! <br /><br />You don’t want to
        get custody of Benji because that would cut into your drinking and
        socialising time so fate has chosen you... can you blame Kelly for
        wanting to move on? You know you want to as well, to many bad memories,
        she’s an untrustworthy crackhead whore... All you do is drink and fight,
        there’s no love at all, it’s disgusting, fucken toxic <br /><br />If
        nothing changes then nothing changes <br /><br />This is what you need
        to get through your thick head, you keep doing the same shit over and
        over, you keep getting the same shit results over and over, you keep
        hating those same shit results, but then you go and do the same shit
        again?? You're on the express train to Loserville with all the other
        scum and trash you know <br /><br />You keep living out this Groundhog
        Day cunt of a life you hate because changing would require some effort,
        pretty much taken the easy road your whole life besides the Tafe course
        you did... you’d have to face that reality can be a bitch but hiding
        from it makes things worse in the long run, you’ll have to go into the
        unknown a bit, what you need to accept is you're going to suffer one way
        or another, just that one way is guaranteed to end bad and the other way
        is going to be decided on how much you can man up <br /><br />Choose
        your pain, sobriety with some loneliness and boredom and being
        responsible vs keep getting shitfaced and end up in hospital or jail and
        single for ever hanging with Boony and Link <br /><br />Age?? I think
        we’ve established 1000 times you hate your life and the person you’ve
        become... drinking, Timo, smoking, drugs, zero confidence, weak... sluts
        and losers aren’t going to fix it... 95% of people you know are either
        alcoholics or drug addicts <br /><br />Another thing, you probably want
        to start pulling your finger out and get back into the coding, if it all
        goes pair shaped and you don’t pull a chick, you’ll at least want some
        money so you can afford one... them box packing cunts down Brooky don’t
        get shit <br /><br />You have to find a job, you have to tell yourself
        not to drink and smoke, you have become so weak physically and mentally,
        they both go hand in hand really <br /><br />
        <br /><br />STOP BEING A WEAK LOSER DERRO CUNT <br /><br />IT’S NOT
        WORKING AND NEVER WILL <br /><br />
        <br /><br />This is the result of living 1 day at a time:
        <br /><br />$100/day on grog and smokes is $37,000 a year
        <br /><br />You need to look at the bigger picture instead of living 1
        day at a time, your instant gratification $100/day filthy habit is
        completely ruining your life, you’re throwing 37k/year away and for
        what? You're not even getting any pussy, making yourself soft and look
        old, you’re just deleting your life and you’re going to end up like
        little Tony, broke depressed addict man-child that no one gives a fuck
        about, just another washed-up derro... or worse, you’re going to meet a
        good chick, fuck it up because you’re a derro and haven’t fixed your
        life, then go through the whole process again <br /><br />You could have
        bought a brand new WRX, car like Trent’s or travelled the world with the
        money you’ve pissed away in the last 2 years... you pissed it away
        because a slut cheated on you and you didn’t have the balls to go and
        meet someone else, so you sulked and drank and smoked all your money
        away... lately you just sit there at the Boaty when there’s chicks
        everywhere, haven’t even tried the last 5 times you’ve been down there
        <br /><br />The best revenge is just to get on with it, meet a decent
        chick, get a job, get healthy, have some good stories, work on your
        weaknesses, she’ll hate you for it, it will be fucking great 😊
        <br /><br />At the moment you’re just playing right into her lap,
        getting all fired up, emotional, nasty, needy, crying, shouting her
        drinks and smokes begging to get in the whore’s pants? It's fucken
        filthy Adrian, you’ve turned into her, a needy brown tonging addict with
        zero standards <br /><br />Notice when you got really angry at that
        Poppy game, you started playing worse and worse, then you started
        thinking negative shit about Kelly, then you felt like a drink... think
        about it, you lose your cool and get upset WAY to easy, this is a
        massive weakness... you hardly even listen to what Benji says because
        your off with the fairies thinking about Kelly or negative rubbish
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You give Benji a hard time for giving up so easy
        <br /><br />He probably gets it from you <br /><br />You’re seeing your
        own weaknesses through Benji <br /><br />Set a good example instead of
        being a derro <br /><br />
        <br /><br />I suppose what you got to think is <br /><br />In General
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />One of your calls is “get a real problem”, c’mon man? A slut
        fucked around on you and you knew about it for ages, let’s be honest
        here, we both just used each other and now you’re acting heartbroken?
        You’re just pissed off at yourself because you haven’t manned up and
        you’re blaming her? Your real problem is your lack of self-control with
        alcohol and cigarettes <br /><br />Another call is “I'd kill for a piece
        of that ass”? Meaning you’d do anything? but then you do absolutely
        nothing, or even worse, you actually lower your chances being a grub,
        then complain you’re single?? <br /><br />Age, this is what is ruining
        your life... If you brought you’re A game when you met Lizzy, you might
        have pulled her or definitely increased your chances... you’re 46, you
        were late, no collared shirt, probably smelt of cigarettes, definitely
        smelt of alcohol, said nothing funny, unprepared as, smokers cough,
        brought up that paternity shit? That was the deal breaker for sure, you
        wouldn’t have said that if you only had a couple drinks? you massive
        fuckwit, huge red flag... you had a fucken shocker – don't cry about it,
        don’t have 1000 drinks over it, you’ve definitely proved that doesn’t
        work – you need to fix the problem with a proper solution... this
        out-of-control drinking is ruining what you want most, now you want to
        drink even more because drinking caused you another problem, you need to
        get this through your head it makes things worse and will never end,
        never, until your dead or in jail <br /><br />Life is actually meant to
        be difficult at times, shit has to go wrong, we’re not in a movie
        princess, your main job in life is to deal with adversities and move on,
        that’s what separates the men from the boys... that’s what your problem
        is? no challenges, no goals, it’s like you're playing the first level of
        Mario Land over and over and over, you’re not pushing yourself and
        moving on, your stagnant... then when life randomly throws you level 2
        or 5, you shit the gear, fuck it up and get drunk crying for
        weeks/months wasting even more of your life... you’re just floating
        through life like Kelly but you don’t have a vagina? you can’t get away
        with it <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Honestly mate, even if you went back to Kelly’s today,
        fucked her and she told you she loved you, nothing would change, you
        would rot your life away with that junkie liar and her derro mother in
        Link housing while she was fucking around... she’s doing you a favor
        forcing you to man up, you should be happy because you’re going to have
        the shittest life with her <br /><br />You should be learning from these
        miserable addict cunts you know; they’re never going to have anything,
        be happy or get any pussy because they’re too weak and gutless to stay
        sober – scared of reality and most of them don’t even have any issues
        <br /><br />It's plain as day mate? You want a good chick, but you’re an
        alcoholic bum with the mental toughness of a toddler, unemployed,
        smoking, no interests or hobbies, living in your mum's basement, Cole's
        car park and the Timo... .and you seriously can’t work out why your life
        is shit? <br /><br />You're eventually going to meet a good chick, and
        it will take her a few weeks to work out you’re a bum derro, like that
        story big Stuey told and you're going to be shattered, saying “I wish I
        pulled my sox up” blah blah like you’ve been saying for fkn years... you
        talk shit like Kelly, lie after lie <br /><br />How good are some of the
        chicks you meet on Tinder? Don't you want one? Or do you want to hang
        out with Link and Boony killing yourself <br /><br />How disgusted with
        yourself were you that Thursday night being at the Timo? Everyone you
        saw was a derro fucking loser, that homeless guy? What a bunch of fkn
        low lives, you could go to Manly where chicks are, but no, you hang out
        with a bunch of old filthy washed-up maggots that never get pussy... and
        then you sulk about being single? <br /><br />Alcohol – the coward's way
        of dealing with life, there’s a difference between enjoying drinks on a
        Saturday night and drinking in Coles car park on a Monday Morning
        <br /><br />Glass half-full mate, count your lucky stars you’re not a
        short fat balding cunt, looking like Monger or Dozza, stuck with some
        fat bird or some high maintenance cunt that doesn’t put out, you have a
        clean slate in a way <br /><br />Russ even has a shit job, but he has
        his own place and a new car because he isn’t an alcoholic – you aren’t
        processing how expensive this habit is and how much of a man-child it
        has turned you into because your brain isn’t working properly...
        constantly sedated <br /><br />You're failing Benji on every level, it’s
        like karma has done this to you <br /><br />You're shooting yourself in
        the foot, you keep trying to fix the problem with the problem, which
        will make the problem last forever, it will be endless failed Tinder
        dates, no money in your account soon, skinny fat and depressed living in
        the past... you have to take the first steps and face the music, you
        need to do it tough for a while, hard road leads to the easy road
        <br /><br />All those miserable cunts on that fb page? All their stories
        are the same, alcohol has ruined my life, not one person has said I'm a
        heavy drinker and loving life, living the dream getting heaps of pussy –
        it’s a no brainer <br /><br />You are pissing away a new car payment
        every week making yourself sick, broke and miserable – you need to see
        what you’re doing to yourself for what it really is – it's fucken sad
        Age, self-sabotage to the max <br /><br />Your scared to check your text
        messages? most guys would reply straight away to show how keen they are
        – alcohol is turning you gay and scared <br /><br />Even Shano said you
        looked hung over from 10 mtrs away, he normally says you look good, I
        just thought he said that to everyone, he could see it <br /><br />You
        keep saying “need to keep busy” but don’t, need to cut down on grog and
        cigarettes” but don’t.... need need need but don’t don’t don’t
        <br /><br />You need to start pushing yourself instead of giving up like
        a toddler, get hard, make it through a hot day sober, don’t get drunk if
        some cunt pisses you off or something doesn’t work out... how are you
        going to get a job or a chick if you can’t even have a few days off the
        piss without crying <br /><br />If you're not getting stronger, you’re
        definitely getting weaker <br /><br />When most guys become single, they
        exercise, get fit, healthy, buy new clothes, get a job, upgrade their
        status getting ready for another chick, you’re going the weak addict
        derro who looks homeless approach... nice <br /><br />You need to start
        going through some stressful situations sober... every little problem
        you have, you run straight to the bottle shop or pub <br /><br />Alcohol
        is turning you into a gay cunt, you don’t even care about pussy when
        you're on it, you don’t care about anything when you’re on it – happy to
        sit with derro’s at the Timo and cunts in Hornsby <br /><br />Be more
        like Russ because what you’re currently doing is killing yourself and
        getting no pussy over a fat abo slut you were only using for sex anyway,
        man up cunt, you’ve wasted so much of your life on that loser, move on,
        stop being an alcoholic little bitch <br /><br />Don't be remembered as
        Age the little bitch, let's take a new approach with this problem - Age
        the man sounds a lot better – think of that Arab cunt you barred on FB
        because he was a negative whiny bitch <br /><br />Jo Simpson rejected
        you for being a man-child, heaps of other chicks have as well, you
        should have been balls deep in that slut... don’t start crying, face it
        and fix it? <br /><br />Not working is turning you into an even softer
        derro cunt <br /><br />You havent even been able to look in the mirror
        lately your so ashamed of yourself, your confidence has never been great
        but at an all-time low now <br /><br />Unless your off your face, you
        feel and look like shit constantly, can’t even sleep properly, haven’t
        done a solid shit in months, car and room full of empties, stinking of
        cigarettes, then you write Kelly off when you’re just as bad... fucking
        disgusting <br /><br />Things are pretty bad when Jo Simpson and Link
        think you're a loser <br /><br />The combo of alcohol and smokes will
        destroy your nervous system... you’ll be a shaking mess with no short
        memory in 10 years <br /><br />You can be pissed off, keep bitching and
        crying, keep throwing all your money away getting uglier, softer,
        weaker, older like the Timo losers you know, have another million drinks
        and it's not going to fix shit <br /><br />Do you think Russ drinks
        himself to death for days after he has a fight with Kharen? He’d be in
        the ground by now if he did, he knows it’s a complete waste of time and
        money, it’s not going to change anything <br /><br />You’re happier when
        you’re busy, not overthinking shit... get back into the coding, back
        into doing anything, you tell yourself you’re a boring cunt all the time
        and do nothing about it? your life is shit because you have done nothing
        to fix it, just bitching sulking and drinking <br /><br />Stop putting
        things off... Tomorrow never comes, do what you can today
        <br /><br />You’re not processing what you are doing to yourself? You
        are destroying your own life at your own hand over a grub
        <br /><br />Most of the time you drink, you feel worse and just regret
        it the next day, even at the time lately... another day of your life
        down the drain, another hunj gone, more disappointment, straight back to
        the bottle’o, it’s never ending, you’re letting the Manly town bike
        destroy you <br /><br />Got to stop the beta finger pointing man-child
        shit, got to stop being impatient and childish, you’re unhappy because
        of the decisions you make, you’re proud of yourself when you do it tough
        or the right thing, not the opposite... the decisions other people make
        are none of your business <br /><br />You’re not upgrading your status,
        buying new shit, creating new experiences in your life because your
        bumming, sub-consciously saving your money for grog and smokes, same as
        Mills, Holden’s, TBB – it’s pretty easy to spot an addict
        <br /><br />It’s annoying most of the time being drunk, you sit here
        unmotivated as, all emotional, the only thing to do is hang out with DY
        scum and chain smoke ciggies <br /><br />See how Craig knows heaps of
        cunts in Manly, if that was you it’d be fuck all if any, you massively
        underestimate how inportant networking is... That story about rapper
        Ryan getting rejected by his miss's multiple times but kept trying and
        finally got the honey pot, you never would have done that, and scratch
        your head wondering why you have no mates or pussy <br /><br />No one
        gives a fuck about your problems; a lot of cunts are glad you have
        them... they’re over a slut, people have their own problems, real
        problems even alcoholics think you’re a dead-beat dad <br /><br />Don’t
        be one of those cunts that stays with a pog their whole life they fucken
        hate just so they’re not single and get pussy – gutless desperate
        co-dependant people pay the ultimate price <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Slut guts <br /><br />Kelly Holden is an untrustworthy
        alcoholic slut – always will be, move on <br /><br />Kelly Holden hates
        you, no matter how nice she acts, never forget it – she's nice when
        she’s using you... you’re always her second option <br /><br />Kelly
        Holden will never change... She will always be an addict slut
        <br /><br />Kelly Holden will ruin your life; you are the only one that
        can change this <br /><br />Kelly is teaching you a lesson for being an
        attached needy Beta, the longer you put up with her rubbish and drink
        with her, the longer you will live a life full of poverty, addiction and
        cheating <br /><br />You are actually turning into Kelly Holden
        <br /><br />The problem with seeing Kelly is it makes it too easy to be
        a derro who doesn’t give a fuck because you can be a full bum and still
        get laid <br /><br />You are getting what you deserve for staying with
        her for all these years, you knew she was anyone's years ago but hung
        around for the easy root and the fact she didn’t care you were a loser
        drunk with no game <br /><br />Same as Kharen, Kelly treats you like a
        piece of shit because you keep going back for more, too forgiving,
        you’re so desperate, you have no morals or standards and she full well
        knows and exploits this weakness <br /><br />You’ve put sluts and
        drinking before your son because you’re a dead-beat <br /><br />You
        blame Kelly for your shit life when it’s really your own fault... you
        hate yourself because the alcohol has made you a boring needy depressed
        Beta and you're living a rubbish addict life, too gutless to stay sober
        and face your issues, you refuse to take the blame or fix it
        <br /><br />You’ve been using Kelly as a slut for years and you’ve hated
        her most of that time, but when she hooks up with another guy, you bring
        feelings and emotions into it? You're really just jealous you haven’t
        manned up <br /><br />Kelly could take half your cash, maybe more if she
        had half a brain <br /><br />You used to enjoy a challenge, really look
        after yourself during the week, now you’re like Kelly, couldn’t give a
        fuck, just living day to day destroying your body and mind over a slut,
        scared of reality junkie. You really are no different to a junkie with
        your current lifestyle <br /><br />Tait was right, you’ll never get
        another job... while you're with Kelly <br /><br />Imagine Kelly went up
        there without Benji and you had had him since the start of lockdown?
        You'd be fuming then! you know Benji’s a big job <br /><br />You’ve
        known her for 10+ years and you haven't wanted to marry the cunt or move
        out with her because she’s an untrustworthy addict piece of shit, just
        an easy fuck and nothing more, biggest loser you’ve ever met, seriously,
        you don’t even like her, she’s anyone's, no future, get over it
        <br /><br />People you know are thinking why the fuck did you stay with
        her? What did you think was going to happen you stupid cunt?
        <br /><br />Every time you fight with her, you end up drinking heavy for
        weeks throwing away your money, health and chances to move on
        <br /><br />How many Tinder chicks have you barred going back to her?
        <br /><br />Kelly’s revealed a few chinks in your armour, you always had
        in the back of your head you were a bit of a stud because you were
        getting easy sex <br /><br />You were meant to use her and move on, like
        she did to you, but you got attached and lazy, you didn’t man up and
        were punished for it <br /><br />Don’t even entertain the thought of
        going back there, you have a very short memory when it comes to all the
        bs lies, anger, betrayal, derro lifestyle, Tait, the cunt has used you
        and shit on you for 10 years <br /><br />You still haven’t got it
        through your head... Kelly Holden is a fat abo slut, accept it, she’s a
        fucking dead shit and it’s better to tap out now than in 5 or 10-years,
        going down the Boaty when your 55? ha-ha, good luck with that
        <br /><br />Give Holden the flick... lack of any future or anything to
        look forward to, looking at Jack, Tait and her getting fatter, poorer
        and uglier is depressing <br /><br />

        uncomfortable situations you're willing to get yourself into and how you
        deal with <br /><br />adversity, rejection and failure.” <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Dead-beat dad <br /><br />The truth definitely hurts on
        occasions... something that just came to my attention recently
        (24/06/21), people have been saying (or thinking) I'm a dead-beat dad,
        sure I have alcohol and depression problems (all self-inflicted) but
        just the term is something that which has really hit home hard because
        it’s true and the truth hurts when it’s bad, Chadd Fox and that shit box
        Craig Holden come to mind, jail bird addicts still acting 15 in their
        40’s.... you must be fucking stupid if you think people see you down the
        Timo every day or hung-over down the road and don’t think you’re a
        full-blown alcoholic? <br /><br />More importantly, I'm being a lazy
        selfish grub, putting the bottle and the biggest losers in DY before my
        son, I made a long-term commitment having Benji and I'm failing on every
        level, I keep saying I'm going to pull my socks up, then I get upset or
        angry over some pointless Kelly shit and drink for 2 weeks straight in
        carparks or with complete derros crying over a slut and the drinking is
        doing nothing to fix the problem, just making it worse <br /><br />I
        turn into such a little bitch when Kelly and I aren’t getting along, I
        turn into a bitch when I don’t have a chick holding my hand, another
        Beta weakness, dependency and attachment, you need to start holding your
        head high like a real man... even when I'm round at her place I do
        nothing with him, he’s nearly 6 and can’t ride a bike, can’t swim,
        haven’t even used that rod I got him for Christmas, never finished the
        Lego I got him for his last birthday, didn’t buy all the shit on that
        list of stuff he needed for school at the start of the year, heaps of
        out of focus shit photos because you're too lazy to manage your proper
        camera, didn’t spend that money I saved on him that mum and BJ let me
        have for not getting them mother and father's day presents, full junkie
        maggot shit, more interested in drinking and fucking a slut, it just
        goes on and on <br /><br />I’m a bum and a dead-beat alcoholic dad,
        <br /><br />
        Jo made a fair call, <br /><br />I need to accept this then fix it asap
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You're letting yourself get outclassed by other guys so
        easily being a lazy cry baby bum alcoholic, then you scratch your head
        and think ‘why aren't I getting any vagina?’ <br /><br />
        <br /><br />More importantly, every time you get on the piss, you’re
        letting down this little guy on so many levels <br /><br />

        <br /><br />The psychology used in drug and alcohol treatment
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Spanian brings up some hard truths in this
        clip... he’s done 13 years, got off a $1500/day heroin habit – now he’s
        healthy, misses, man's up, makes money <br /><br />Alcoholism is not a
        disease, it’s a choice... you’re DNA hasn’t changed, you haven’t caught
        anything, you’re not a victim, you’re a derro <br /><br />You don’t need
        rehab to learn there’s better things in life than drinking, do you need
        to be treated like a child or a 31er to work this out?
        <br /><br />You’re not going to stop drinking because you like something
        better, you need to hate yourself and your life to change, I do hate my
        life but refuse to face it... Only you can stop yourself from drinking
        <br /><br />Being an alcoholic makes you ugly, weak, broke and
        depressed, can’t pull good chicks... it causes depression and makes you
        a Beta, look at Link? <br /><br />Don’t you want a better life? Be more
        attractive? Stronger? Form better relationships? have a great girl?
        Money? Go on holidays? Own nice shit? <br /><br />Stop pretending you’re
        a victim or you’ve done it tough... YOU have made the choice to become
        an alcoholic, you’re not being an adult, you're hiding from your
        problems, stop it or live with the consequences <br /><br />

        <br /><br />Fuck, I had just over 70K in my Flexi at the start of the
        year, 90K a year ago, now I have just over 50K as of end of July, this
        is the serious side effect of being an alcoholic man-child, I’m not even
        having a good time? I'm paying to make my life worse? If I was more like
        Russ, it would have been about 2-3K maybe... haven’t seen Kelly in
        months either so I can’t even blame that cunt, plus I haven’t been
        buying groceries, paying bills, haven't even been to the pub in months,
        do the maths cunt? You're drinking is getting worse, heaps fucken worse,
        your Flexi will be non-existent late 2022 at this rate <br /><br />
        <br /><br />28K pissed away in a year? <br /><br />That’s about
        $540/week out of your flexi <br /><br />Think of the sick pad you could
        have set up the money you spent on grog and durries? You could have had
        a place like Mill’s with top of the range shit, new bike, nice car,
        buffed etc. Where did that drinking/smoking get you? Kelly’s glad you’re
        a cry baby maggot, you’re staying on her level, level loser
        <br /><br />Currently you should be living off $45/day <br /><br />Use
        Mills as an example of how not to be, dress sense, shitty bed, she’s
        like this because she’s an alcoholic and doesn’t give a fuck if she
        looks like a grub as long as she’s drinking, this is what alcohol abuse
        does to people.... what woman is going to feel welcome here? they’ll see
        you as Mills, old car, old mattress, you’re not buying new shit because
        you’re a lazy alcoholic who doesn’t give a fuck about anything except
        getting on it <br /><br />It's funny when you see Mills, you think what
        a fucking loser, drinking in the morning, chain smoking, zero
        self-respect, hanging with the scum of Dee Why, smoking pot, fat,
        unhealthy, childish, addicted, shit bed, shit TV but always has a drink,
        pot and smokes, looks heaps older than what she should, carries on like
        a fucking retard repeating herself, exactly like Kelly, she’s a fucking
        scum, I somehow feel sorry for the loser but 95% of people would think
        she’s a straight up fucking maggot because SHE’S made the choice to be
        like that <br /><br />Tash, Kylie etc didn’t give a fuck about your
        alcohol problem, no one does, they just fucked you off and moved on,
        you’ve made the choice to be like that <br /><br />People don’t need
        another person's selfish addiction problems in their lives...

        <br /><br />10 Laws of Manhood <br /><br />Take control — Manliness
        isn’t in your height or being ripped. It’s your ability to take action
        instead of waiting for other people to do it. <br /><br />Know the rules
        of exchange — If you don’t receive back the respect and time you give to
        someone, walk the fuck away! <br /><br />Be financially smart — Nothing
        is sexier than having money in the bank. Develop high-income skills,
        curb your spending, learn to invest. <br /><br />Have a strong posture —
        Your posture can make or break your first impression. Forward head
        posture, hunchbacks can get you labelled as a nerd, nerds don’t get
        pussy <br /><br />Don’t be a people pleaser — learn to say no, do what’s
        right in your mind, who gives a fuck if anyone thinks less of you, be
        selfish like everyone else <br /><br />Don't submit to peer pressure —
        Don’t smoke, drink and party because others want you to. Make decisions
        based on what you like. <br /><br />Embrace solitude — Don’t smoke,
        drink and party because you’re bored or lonely. You full well know how
        that works out <br /><br />Be confident with humility — Weak men
        criticize others to feel good whereas true confidence lies in supporting
        others. <br /><br />Make eye-contact — It’s repulsive when you don’t
        have the guts to look people in the eye. Keep eye-contact until they
        look away. <br /><br />Solve problems — Problems are inevitable in life.
        Instead of freaking out like a chicken and getting drunk, stay calm and
        act rationally. <br /><br />Be bold — Have the balls to say what you
        mean. Nobody likes your ‘fake-nice’ gestures. <br /><br />Don’t be needy
        — You shouldn’t need that girl or group of friends. Have a life of your
        own. Goals you are committed to. <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Pamela is taking you down Brooky soon if you're not careful
        cunt, then you’ll have something to cry and drink about
        <br /><br />Everything goes well in my life when I'm off the drink, I
        eat well, exercise, sleep well, don’t smoke, think about my future and
        what needs to be done, respect my money, do stuff with Benji, the list
        goes on... when I'm on the piss, all of the above stuff is the exact
        opposite, fuck up after fuck up <br /><br />You've been bitching and
        moaning for 20+ years on and off about all your fuck ups, all the chicks
        you’ve lost, all the jobs you’ve lost, all the money you've wasted, fuck
        up after fuck up you’ve made because of alcohol and you’ve done
        absolutely nothing to fix it? If anything, you’ve gotten worse, you
        never used to morning drink or spend $100/day drinking alone chain
        smoking <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You only want to do something about it when you're getting
        no pussy, even worse now, you’re not doing anything at all
        <br /><br />If you don’t do something about it soon, you’ll be working a
        factory job with Link drinking with Boony getting no pussy for the rest
        of your miserable life which will probably be short, sad and painful,
        batting off in your parent's basement collecting Centrelink, hating
        yourself even more for not changing when you could (perfect time is
        right now, low stress, no job, Covid, got cash in the bank), then you’ll
        really have something to be miserable about <br /><br />It's funny, I
        couldn’t believe those bums Jen knew in DY and I was embarrassed to be
        associated with them, this is probably exactly how Russ saw me down the
        Timo when I was sitting at the table of derros and why he said ‘I never
        want to be a pub local’ that was his polite way of saying ‘if you hang
        with these losers long enough, you’ll turn into one and never get any
        pussy’ but to me it was completely normal, I was almost proud of myself,
        like that shit box Craig Holden when he’s hanging with all those drug
        addict jail birds who still think they’re 15 <br /><br />90% of your
        problems are alcohol related <br /><br />As Link said “All of your
        problems are easy to fix” - and they really are, It’s the perfect time
        (late July 21) to sober up though, coronavirus lockdown, all pubs and
        clubs are closed, low stress not going into work I couldn’t ask for
        better conditions really, except to have a decent girl in my life but I
        suppose my choices have kind of ruined that concept and if I met one,
        I'd probably just fuck it up, I’m not ready, can’t even stay off the
        piss for 5 days during the week <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Imagine <br /><br />Imagine waking up next to one of those
        hot chicks you see down Manly? <br /><br />Imagine getting ahead in life
        and enjoying it sober? <br /><br />Imagine not being a slave to alcohol
        and cigarettes? <br /><br />Imagine getting healthy, looking good,
        saving money and going on holidays? <br /><br />Imagine looking forward
        to life instead of trying to constantly avoid reality?
        <br /><br />Imagine never having to associate with the dregs of the
        barrel ever again? <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />That should be more than enough motivation stop being a
        derro man child, get off the piss, get a job and you're act together
        before it's too late <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You’re the problem! <br /><br />I'm actually really starting
        to think I'm the problem, I just seem to stir people up when I'm on the
        piss... meeting Mills was a real eye opener; I got a view of how normal
        chicks see me <br /><br />I say stupid shit, get up on my high-horse and
        I’m lazy and selfish, sure Kelly’s a cunt, I’m the one who brought her
        into my life, I'm the one who followed my dick because I was Beta and
        too lazy and gutless to meet other people, Beta’s always stay with low
        standard chicks because they know they can’t do any better, like Ant and
        that Andrew derro, I was always going to pay the price for that which
        just happens to be right now in lockdown, I knew this 8 or 9 years ago I
        just put up with it for the easy sex... 2 minutes of doggy with a whore
        is not worth throwing your life away putting up with that lying trash
        bag slut, you have completely overrated that whore because you can’t
        handle being on your own and facing the fact you need to man up and find
        a new girl, because this would take effort and some balls, this has
        happened because you’re a lazy emotional alcoholic... she’s well past
        her heyday, you should have run for the hills when she got back on the
        piss, your life has been misery since December 2019, good times when we
        first met and when she got out of rehab but now, she’s just a fat using
        slut who hardly puts out <br /><br />Remember Steve the removalist? Kept
        going back to a whore and it ruined his life... Same shit exactly...
        little Tone as well, but who knows, both them guys are alcoholics, they
        could have been the problem <br /><br />
        <br /><br />I wouldn't worry too much about being unemployed and at your
        parent's place at the moment, they’re easy fixes... you should be
        focusing on your alcohol and cigarette addiction and your depression,
        you need to sort your general health out first before you shoot for the
        stars <br /><br />You’re guaranteed the shittiest life ever with your
        current drinking and smoking habits <br /><br />worst shit you could do
        right now is pull a hottie and have her leave you because you’re a bum
        alcoholic <br /><br />You've got to be careful hanging out with dogs,
        sluts, cunts, addicts and bums etc., humans adapt, eventually that human
        trash will become your normal and you’ll become trash like Kelly and the
        like, seeing rubbish as normal <br /><br />You’re an unfit cunt Kinross,
        way too many durries, didn't even last 3 minutes of doggy with Mills, I
        was huffin and puffin like a fat guy who just walked up heaps of stairs
        <br /><br />One day, you are going to regret what are you are doing now
        so badly, you’ll probably meet a nice girl, get a good job, then you’ll
        have a stroke or some other organ malfunction because of the shit you’re
        doing now, drinking myself to death over a fat abo slut and where did it
        get me? Absolutely fucking nowhere” what did it fix? Nothing
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />What do women look for in a man? <br /><br />Honestly? what
        do you have to offer a woman your own age? You're 45 and camping in your
        parents' basement unemployed with addiction problems? What sort of
        chicks do you think you are going to pull out of that? You could get
        away with it when you were younger but now, you’re just going to rot
        like Chadd Fox and that Craig Holden shit box, those cunts even have
        their own places... You'll be fucking around with Kelly’s and Jennifer’s
        for ever, the money you waste on grog you could get a place like Jen’s
        easily, be able to cook and experience being a man for a measly extra
        $100/week <br /><br />The whole idea of being a man is to have
        confidence, balls, self-discipline, not be a cry baby addict looking for
        a quick fix <br /><br />Look what happened with Nicole and how I haven't
        contacted her for nearly 8 months because of my alcohol problem?
        probably got a Bobby Dazzler chick in her, that farm she had sounded
        awesome, not a slut maggot, probably loves a good shag and a good
        conversation and you’re hanging with Boony and Link at the Wanksville
        pub

        Fact:: The world’s oldest wooden wheel has been around for more than
        5,000 years It was found in 2002, approximately 12 miles south of
        Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and is now housed in the city’s
        museum. Radiocarbon dating was used to determine the wheel’s age, which
        is somewhere between 5,100 and 5,350 years old. Closer to home, these
        are the oldest tourist attractions in every state. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES

        they have to go somewhere when we’re indoors. If the idea of skin dust
        isn’t sitting well with you, you should know that a report from the
        American Chemical Society found that a skin oil called squalene
        naturally helps reduce indoor ozone levels by up to 15 percent. RD.COM,

        White and the Seven Dwarfs. But 20 years earlier, a full-length animated
        feature film was made in Argentina. It was a political satire called El
        Apóstol made up of 58,000 drawings and had a running time of 70 minutes,
        according to the Guinness Book of World Records. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES

        Fact:: German chocolate cake was invented in Texas The “German” part of
        German chocolate cake comes from an American man—not a European country.
        Specifically, it’s named after Sam German, who in 1852 created the
        formula for a mild dark baking chocolate bar for Baker’s Chocolate
        Company, which was subsequently named Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate.
        Fast-forward to June 13, 1957. The Dallas Morning Star published the
        recipe for the cake, invented and submitted by a reader identified as
        Mrs. George Clay, according to What’s Cooking America. RD.COM, GETTY

        Fact:: Marla Gibbs continued to work as a flight attendant for two years
        after being cast on a hit TV show Prior to taking her place on the stoop
        of 227, Marla Gibbs played the housekeeper Florence on The Jeffersons (a
        spin-off of All in the Family). In a 2015 interview, Gibbs told the
        Washington Post that despite it appearing as though she had gotten her
        big break, she kept her job as a flight attendant for American Airlines
        for two more years—just to be safe. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES (2)

        Fact:: The Philippines consists of 7,641 islands The Philippines is an
        archipelago, which means it’s made up of a group of islands—7,641
        islands, to be exact. That figure does not include the thousands of
        sandbars and other landforms that emerge during low tide. RD.COM, GETTY

        3,901 bridges Not only is the Trans-Siberian Railway the longest
        railroad in Russia, but it’s also the longest one in the world. The
        journey takes seven days, during which time passengers pass through
        eight different time zones and cross 3,901 bridges. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES

        Fact:: The Golden Girls was supposed to have a different theme song
        That’s right: Instead of Andrew Gold’s iconic “Thank You for Being a
        Friend,” the show’s producers wanted to use Bette Midler’s song
        “Friends,” according to Jim Colucci, author of the book Golden Girls
        Forever: An Unauthorized Look Behind the Lanai. But the rights to the
        Divine Miss M’s song were too expensive, and the rest is sitcom history.

        Fact:: There’s enough gold inside Earth to coat the planet Turns out,
        there’s quite a bit of gold on—or, really, in—our planet: 99 percent of
        the precious metal can be found in the Earth’s core, Discover Magazine
        reports. How much is there? Enough to coat the entire surface of the
        Earth in 1.5 feet of gold. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES (2)

        Fact:: Cleveland was once the country’s fifth-largest city Data from the
        1920 U.S. census indicates that Cleveland, Ohio, was one of the most
        heavily populated cities in the country, behind only Detroit,
        Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City. Today, these are the largest
        cities in the world. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES (2)

        Fact:: Human beings can use only a small fraction of Earth’s water In
        school, we were taught that most (specifically, 71 percent) of the
        planet’s surface is covered in water. While that’s true, humans can use
        only 0.007 percent of that water, according to National Geographic.
        That’s because only about 2.5 percent of Earth’s water is fresh water,
        and only 1 percent of that is accessible. The rest makes up glaciers and
        snowfields. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES (2)

        Fact:: People once ate arsenic to improve their skin You’ve probably
        heard about how a lot of the Victorians’ favorite cosmetics were riddled
        with arsenic, but it gets worse. There were also products on the market
        in the late 19th century, like Dr. James P. Campbell’s Safe Arsenic
        Complexion Wafers, that were meant to be eaten. They claimed to get rid
        of freckles, blackheads, and other “facial disfigurements.” Admit it:
        That’s one of the most interesting facts you’ve learned in a while.

        United States with her two younger brothers aboard the SS Nevada after
        departing from Queenstown, Ireland (now known as Cobh). Another amazing

        Fact:: Professional athletes used to perform in vaudeville during the
        off-season Before today’s big-league salaries, professional baseball and
        football players often had to take on jobs during the off-season, The
        Atlantic reports. Some of them took advantage of their name recognition
        and hit the vaudeville circuits, doing everything from comedy routines
        to reciting poems. Babe Ruth even sang—if you could call it that.
        Frankly, many of the athletes had no business being on stage, but it’s
        not like it was against the rules, unlike these strange things that have
        been banned in sports. RD.COM, GETTY IMAGES (2)

        Fact:: The first time the word “period” was used on TV in reference to
        menstruation was 1985 It came via a line in a Tampax commercial:
        “Feeling cleaner is more comfortable. It can actually change the way you
        feel about your period.” And the actor who made pop culture history was
        Courtney Cox of Friends fame.

        Fact:: Some fungi create zombies, then control their minds The tropical
        fungus Ophiocordyceps infects ants’ central nervous systems. Once it has
        been in an insect’s body for nine days, it has complete control over the
        host’s movements. According to National Geographic, it forces the ant to
        climb trees, then convulse and fall into the cool, moist soil below,
        where fungi thrive. Once there, the fungus waits until exactly solar
        noon to force the ant to bite a leaf and wait for death.

        Fact:: The first oranges weren’t orange The original oranges from
        Southeast Asia were a tangerine-pomelo hybrid, and they were actually
        green. In fact, oranges in warmer regions, such as Vietnam and Thailand,
        still stay green through maturity. Speaking of which, ever wonder which
        “orange” came first: the color or the fruit? We found out!

        the apples on those trees were much more bitter than the ones you’d find
        in the supermarket today. “Johnny Appleseed” didn’t expect his fruits to
        be eaten whole but rather made into hard apple cider.

        Fact:: The Windy City nickname has nothing to do with Chicago’s weather
        If you live in Chicago, you might already know this random fact, but
        we’re betting most other people don’t. Chicago’s nickname was coined by
        19th-century journalists who were referring to the fact that its
        residents were “windbags” and “full of hot air.”

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Peanuts aren’t technically nuts They’re legumes. According to
        Merriam-Webster, a nut is only a nut if it’s “a hard-shelled dry fruit
        or seed with a separable rind or shell and interior kernel.” That means
        walnuts, almonds, cashews, and pistachios aren’t nuts either. They’re
        seeds.

        Fact:: Armadillo shells are bulletproof In fact, one Texas man was
        hospitalized when a bullet he shot at an armadillo ricocheted off the

        These animal “facts,” however, are false.

        Fact:: Firefighters use wetting agents to make water wetter The

        Fact:: Some octopus species lay 56,000 eggs at a time On average, a
        giant Pacific octopus will lay 56,000 eggs at the end of a pregnancy,
        over the course of about a month, NPR reports. At first, these new
        babies float through the surrounding water unattached to one another or
        their mother. But then the mother gathers each egg—which is about the
        size of a grain of rice—and weaves them into braids, allowing her to
        keep an eye on everyone at the same time.

        Fact:: Cats have fewer toes on their back paws Like most four-legged
        mammals, cats have five toes on the front, but their back paws only have

        faster. Here are more purr-fectly fascinating facts about cats.

        Fact:: Kleenex tissues were originally intended for gas masks When there
        was a cotton shortage during World War I, Kimberly-Clark developed a
        thin, flat cotton substitute that the army tried to use as a filter in
        gas masks. The war ended before scientists perfected the material, so
        the company redeveloped it to be smoother and softer, then marketed
        Kleenex as facial tissue instead.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Turkeys can blush When turkeys are scared or excited—like when
        the males see a female they’re interested in—the pale skin on their head
        and neck turns bright red, blue, or white. The flap of skin over their
        beaks, called a snood, also reddens. By the way, this is why the
        president pardons a turkey every Thanksgiving.

        Fact:: Most Disney characters wear gloves to keep animation simple Walt
        Disney might have been the first to put gloves on his characters, as
        seen in 1929’s The Opry House, starring Mickey Mouse. In addition to
        being easier to animate, there’s another reason for the gloves: “We
        didn’t want him to have mouse hands because he was supposed to be more
        human,” Disney told his biographer in 1957.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: The man with the world’s deepest voice can make sounds humans
        can’t hear The man, Tim Storms, can’t even hear the note, which is eight
        octaves below the lowest G on a piano—but elephants can.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: The current American flag was designed by a high school student
        It started as a school project for Bob Heft’s junior-year history class
        in 1958, and it only earned a B-minus. His design had 50 stars, even
        though Alaska and Hawaii weren’t states yet; Heft figured the two would
        earn statehood soon and showed the government his design. After
        President Dwight D. Eisenhower called to say the design was approved,
        Heft’s teacher changed his grade to an A.

        Fact:: Cows don’t have upper front teeth They do have molars on top, in
        the back of their mouths, but where you’d expect upper incisors, cows,
        sheep, and goats have a thick layer of tissue called a dental pad. They
        use that with their bottom teeth to pull out grass.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Thanks to 3D printing, NASA can basically email tools to
        astronauts Getting new equipment to the Space Station used to take

        Fact:: Only a quarter of the Sahara Desert is sandy Most of it is
        covered in gravel, though it also contains mountains and oases. And
        here’s another geography fact that everyone gets wrong: It isn’t the
        world’s largest desert. Antarctica is.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Bananas grow upside down Or technically, we peel them upside
        down. Naturally, they grow outward from their stems, but that means
        their bottoms actually face the sky. As they get bigger, the fruits turn
        toward the sun, forming that distinctive curve.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: There were active volcanoes on the moon when dinosaurs were alive
        Most of the volcanoes probably stopped erupting about a billion years
        ago, but NASA findings have suggested there might still have been active
        lava flow 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still roaming.

        Fact:: Dogs sniff good smells with their left nostril Dogs normally
        start sniffing with their right nostril, then keep it there if the smell

        pleasant, like food or a mating partner. If you’re a dog lover, you’ll

        Fact:: Avocados were named after reproductive organs You’ll never look
        at avocados the same way again. Indigenous people of Mexico and Central
        America used the Nahuatl word āhuacatl to mean both “testicles” and
        “avocado.” The fruits were originally marketed as “alligator pears” in
        the United States until the current name stuck.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: T. S. Eliot wore green makeup No one is sure why the poet dusted
        his face with green powder, though some guess he was just trying to look

        Fact:: The word “fizzle” started as a type of fart In the 1400s, it

        Fact:: Human noses and ears get bigger as we age It’s pretty common to
        see the claim that our nose and ears are the only parts of our body that
        keep growing as we age, but that’s not exactly true. Our nose and ears
        stop growing along with the rest of our body, but thanks to the weight
        of gravity, both parts continue to lengthen over time, according to the
        Discovery Channel.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: No number before 1,000 contains the letter A But there are plenty

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: The # symbol isn’t officially called hashtag or pound Its
        technical name is octothorpe. The “octo” means “eight” and refers to its
        points, though reports disagree on where “thorpe” came from. Some claim
        it was named after Olympian Jim Thorpe, while others argue it was just a
        nonsense suffix.

        Fact:: The French have their own name for a French kiss Something extra
        interesting about this kissing fact? The word hasn’t been around for
        long. In 2014, galocher—meaning to kiss with tongues—was added to the
        Petit Robert French dictionary.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: You can thank the Greeks for calling Christmas “Xmas” In Greek,
        the word for “Christ” starts with the letter Chi, which looks like an X
        in the Roman alphabet. If you’re fascinated by this fact, you’ll be
        equally transfixed by the history of these Christmas symbols.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Movie trailers originally played after the movie They “trailed”
        the feature film—hence, the name. The first trailer appeared in 1912 and
        was for a Broadway show, not a movie.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Mercedes invented a car controlled by a joystick The joystick in
        the 1966 Mercedes F200 showcase car controlled speed and direction,
        replacing both the steering wheel and pedals. The car could also sense
        which side the driver was sitting in, so someone could control it from
        the passenger seat.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: H&M actually stands for something This is one of those
        interesting facts you’ve probably never thought about before. The
        clothing retail shop was originally called Hennes—Swedish for
        “hers”—before acquiring the hunting and fishing equipment brand Mauritz
        Widforss. Eventually, Hennes & Mauritz was shortened to H&M.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: The U.S. government saved every public tweet from 2006 through
        2017 Starting in 2018, the Library of Congress decided to only keep
        tweets on “a very selective basis,” including elections and those
        dealing with something of national interest, like public policy.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Theodore Roosevelt had a pet hyena Its name was Bill, and it was
        a present from the Ethiopian emperor. Roosevelt was famous for his many
        pets, including a one-legged rooster, a badger, a pony, and a small
        bear. And he’s not the only one who had an interest in unusual
        animals—here are more bizarre pets owned by U.S. presidents.

        Fact:: The CIA headquarters has its own Starbucks, but baristas don’t
        write names on the cups Its receipts say “Store Number 1” instead of
        “Starbucks,” and its workers need an escort to leave their work posts.

        Fact:: There’s only one U.S. state capital without a McDonald’s
        Montpelier, Vermont, doesn’t have any of those Golden Arches. It also
        happens to have the smallest population of any state capital, with just
        7,500 residents.

        Fact:: Europeans were scared of eating tomatoes when they were
        introduced Scholars think Hernán Cortés brought the seeds in 1519 with
        the intent of the fruits being used ornamentally in gardens. By the
        1700s, aristocrats started eating tomatoes, but they were convinced the
        fruits were poisonous because people would die after eating them. In
        reality, the acidity from the tomatoes brought out the lead in their
        pewter plates, and they actually died of lead poisoning.

        Fact:: Humans aren’t the only animals that dream Studies have indicated
        rats dream about getting to food or running through mazes. Most mammals
        go through REM sleep, the cycle in which dreams occur, so scientists
        think there’s a good chance they all dream.

        Fact:: The inventor of the microwave appliance received only $2 for his
        discovery Percy Spencer was working as a researcher for American
        Appliance Company (now Raytheon) when he noticed that a radar set using
        electromagnetic waves melted the candy bar in his pocket. He had the
        idea to make a metal box using microwaves to heat food, but the company
        was the one to file the patent. That was in 1945, and he received a $2
        bonus but never any royalties. Check out the most important invention

        Fact:: Glitter may have originated on a ranch According to local lore, a
        man by the name of Henry Ruschmann from Bernardsville, New Jersey,
        invented glitter by accident in 1934 while working on a cattle ranch.
        The New York Times reports that in the popular origin story, Ruschmann,
        a machinist, was trying to find a way to dispose of scrap material by
        crushing it into tiny pieces. Plastic went in, glitter came out, and the
        rest is commonly accepted as history. RD.COM, VIA AMAZON.COM,

        Fact:: Frankenstein’s Creature is a vegetarian Both Victor Frankenstein
        and Creature are fictional characters in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. In
        the classic novel, Creature says, “My food is not that of man; I do not
        destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries
        afford me sufficient nourishment.” This is one of the interesting facts

        Fact:: Sloths have more neck bones than giraffes Despite the difference
        in neck length, there are more bones in the neck of a sloth than a
        giraffe. There are seven vertebrae in the neck of a giraffe, and in most
        mammals, but there are 10 in a sloth’s. While they’re on your mind, here

        Fact:: Cap’n Crunch’s full name is Horatio Magellan Crunch He’s also
        been called out for only having the bars of a Navy commander, but the
        so-called cap’n held his ground on Twitter, arguing that captaining the
        S.S. Guppy with his crew “makes an official Cap’n in any book!” While
        the cap’n is a fictional character, these are the real people behind
        some famous food brands.

        Fact:: Paint used to be stored in pig bladders The bladder would be
        sealed with a string and then pricked to get the paint out. This option
        wasn’t the best because it would often break open. American painter John
        G. Rand was the innovator who, in the 19th century, made paint tubes
        from tin and screw caps.

        Fact:: Humans have jumped farther than horses in the Olympics The
        Olympic world record for the longest human long jump is greater than the
        world record for longest horse long jump. Mike Powell set the record in
        1991 by jumping 8.95 meters, and the horse Extra Dry set the record in
        1900 by jumping 6.10 meters. Speaking of random fun facts about the

        Fact:: Onions were found in the eyes of an Egyptian mummy Pharaoh Ramses
        IV of ancient Egypt had his eyes replaced with small onions when he was
        mummified. The rings and layers of onions were worshipped because people
        thought they represented eternal life. This aligns with the reason for
        mummification: to allow the pharaoh to live forever.

        Fact:: Abraham Lincoln was a bartender You know that the 16th president
        of the United States fought for the freedom of slaves and the Union, but
        what you didn’t know is that he was a licensed bartender. Lincoln’s
        liquor license was discovered in 1930 and displayed in a Springfield
        liquor store. According to Wayne C. Temple, a Lincoln expert, Congress
        wanted to fire Ulysses S. Grant in 1863 because he drank a lot, and
        Lincoln’s response was to send Grant a supply of whiskey. Here are more
        facts about U.S. presidents even history buffs don’t know.

        bar that were inspired by sushi but didn’t actually taste like raw fish.
        The tuna sushi was raspberry, the seaweed-wrapped one tasted like
        pumpkin pudding, and the sea urchin sushi was the flavor of Hokkaido
        melon with mascarpone cheese. All were made with puffed rice, white
        chocolate, and a bit of wasabi.

        Fact:: An employee at Pixar accidentally deleted a sequence of Toy Story
        2 during production Ed Catmull, the cofounder of Pixar, wrote in his
        book, Creativity Inc., that the year before the movie came out, someone
        entered the command ‘/bin/rm -r -f *’ on the drive where the files were
        saved, and scenes started deleting. It would have taken a year to
        recreate what was deleted, but luckily another employee had a backup of
        the entire film on her laptop at home.

        form the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976. But the company was
        not fully incorporated until January 3, 1977. Thirty years later, the
        company was renamed Apple Inc. and is no joke. In 2018, Apple became the
        country’s first trillion-dollar company. Of course, computers have come
        a long way over the years—here’s what computers looked like the decade

        Fact:: The inventor of the tricycle personally delivered two to Queen
        Victoria In 1881, Queen Victoria was on a tour on the Isle of Wight when
        her horse and carriage could not keep up with a woman riding a tricycle.
        Intrigued by the bike, the queen proceeded to order two. She also asked
        that the inventor, James Starley, arrive with the delivery. Though you
        might associate tricycles with toddlers, Queen Victoria made them cool
        among the elite at the time.

        Fact:: Your brain synapses shrink while you sleep Researchers at the
        University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Sleep and Consciousness
        studied mice to observe what happens to their brains while they sleep.
        Dr. Chiara Cirelli and Dr. Giulio Tononi found an 18 percent decrease in
        the size of synapses after a few hours of sleep. Don’t worry,
        though—this nighttime brain shrinkage actually helps your cognitive
        abilities. Speaking of your mind, did you know that these brain myths

        Fact:: A waffle iron inspired one of the first pairs of Nikes Bill
        Bowerman was a track and field coach in the 1950s who didn’t like how
        running shoes were made. He first created the Cortez shoe but wanted a
        sneaker that was even lighter and could be worn on a variety of
        surfaces. During a waffle breakfast with his wife in 1970, he came up
        with the idea of using the waffle texture on the soles of running shoes.
        Waffle-soled shoes made their big debut in the 1972 U.S. Olympic track
        and field trials in Eugene, Oregon.

        Fact:: Boars wash their food National Geographic reported that at Basel
        Zoo in Switzerland, zookeepers watched adult and juvenile wild boars
        pick up sandy apples and bring them to a nearby creek in their
        environment to wash before eating. Though some items like sugar beets
        were eaten without the human-like behavior, the boars brought a whole
        dead chicken to the creek to wash before chowing down. One ecologist
        called this a “luxury behavior.” Find out which other animals are the

        Fact:: Baseball umpires used to sit in rocking chairs People have been
        playing baseball since the mid-19th century. In the early days, umpires
        would officiate the games while reclining in a rocking chair located 20
        feet behind home plate. By 1878, the National League also declared that
        home teams must pay umpires $5 per game.

        Fact:: The first commercial passenger flight lasted only 23 minutes In
        1914, Abram Pheil paid $400 (which would be $8,500 today) for a
        23-minute plane ride. The Florida flight flew between Saint Petersburg
        and Tampa, where only 21 miles of water separate the cities. Pheil, a
        former mayor of Saint Petersburg, and the pilot, Tony Jannus, were the
        only passengers. This momentous flight paved the way for air travel as
        we know it. Speaking of which, here are some airplane facts you’ve

        woman who called 999 (the U.K. version of 911) because there were “bits
        on one side and none on the other,” she says in the recording. She was
        even more upset when the ice cream truck man did not want to give her

        Fact:: Uncle Ben’s rice was air-dropped to World War II troops German
        chemist Erich Huzenlaub invented a process of parboiling rice to keep
        more nutrients in the rice and lessen the cooking time. The “Huzenlaub
        Process” had another unexpected benefit: It stopped bug infestations.
        The quick-cook, bug-free rice was a big advantage during World War II,
        and converted rice (as it was then known) was air-dropped to American
        and British troops. After the war, the company rebranded itself and
        became Uncle Ben’s Original Converted Brand Rice, named after one of the
        company’s best rice suppliers. The product hit grocery store shelves in
        1947.

        Fact:: South American river turtles talk in their eggs Turtles don’t
        have vocal cords, and their ears are internal, so scientists believed
        that turtles were deaf and didn’t communicate through sounds. But
        research has found that turtles actually communicate at an extremely low
        frequency that sounds like “clicks, clucks, and hoots” that can only be
        heard through a hydrophone (a microphone used underwater). These sounds
        even come from the egg before the turtle hatches. Researchers
        hypothesize that this helps all the turtle siblings hatch at once.

        Fact:: Penicillin was first called “mold juice” In 1928, bacteriologist
        Alexander Fleming left a petri dish in his lab while he was on
        vacation—only to return and find that some liquid around the mold had
        killed the bacteria in the dish. This became the world’s first
        antibiotic, but before naming it penicillin, he called it “mold juice.”
        Here are more accidental discoveries that changed the world.

        Fact:: The first stroller was engineered to be pulled by a goat (or
        animal of similar size) William Kent, a landscape architect, invented
        the first stroller for the third Duke of Devonshire in 1733. But
        upper-class parents were hardly expected to put effort into transporting
        their children around, so Kent designed his model to be pulled by a
        small animal, like a goat.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: May 20, 1873, is the “birthday” of blue jeans According to the
        Levi Strauss company, this was the day that Levi Strauss and Jacob
        Davis, the innovators behind the sturdy blue jeans we all love, got a
        patent on the process of adding metal rivets to men’s denim work pants.
        The pants were called waist overalls until 1960, when baby boomers began
        calling them jeans. And FYI, this is why blue is the most popular denim
        color.

        Fact:: 170-year-old bottles of champagne were found at the bottom of the
        Baltic Sea The bottles of bubbly are believed to have been traveling
        from Germany to Russia during the 1800s when they sank to the bottom of
        the sea, according to New Scientist. It turns out that the bottom of the
        sea, where temperatures are between two and four degrees Celsius, is a
        great place for wine aging. Wine experts sampled the champagne and
        described it as “sometimes cheesy” with “animal notes” and elements of
        “wet hair.” Mmm.

        Fact:: The MGM lion roar is trademarked At the start of any movie made
        by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, the iconic lion roars at the
        audience. While MGM has gone through several iterations of lion mascots,
        the sound of the roar is always the same. The company trademarked the
        “sound mark” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the
        1980s. Believe it or not, these famous phrases are also trademarked.

        Fact:: Neil Armstrong’s hair was sold in 2004 for $3,000 The lucky
        buyer, John Reznikoff, holds the Guinness World Record for the largest
        collection of hair from historical celebrities, reports NBC. But
        Armstrong’s lawyers threatened to sue Marx Sizemore, the not-so-lucky
        barber who cut the former astronaut’s hair; they said he violated an
        Ohio law that protects the rights of famous people. Sizemore said he
        wouldn’t pay, and Reznikoff said he wouldn’t give back the hair but that
        he’d donate $3,000 to charity.

        Fact:: Irish bars used to be closed on Saint Patrick’s Day You might
        associate Saint Patrick’s Day with wearing green and drinking so much
        you think you actually see leprechauns. But until 1961, there were laws
        in Ireland that banned bars from opening on March 17. Since the holiday
        falls during the period of Lent in the heavily Catholic country, the
        idea of binge-drinking seemed a bit immoral.

        Fact:: Nikola Tesla hated pearls The electrical engineer paved the way
        for current system generators and motors; the way electricity gets
        transmitted and converted to mechanical power is thanks to his
        inventions. But despite his patience with scientific experimentation, he
        apparently had no tolerance for pearls. When his secretary wore pearl
        jewelry one day, he made her go home.

        Fact:: Thomas Edison is the reason you love cat videos After inventing
        the kinetograph in 1892, Edison was able to record and watch moving
        images for the first time. He filmed short clips in his studio, some of
        which feature famous people like Annie Oakley and Buffalo Bill. But the
        real stars of these early videos are the Boxing Cats—adorable cats that
        he recorded in a boxing ring circa 1894. If you like cat videos, you’ll
        also appreciate these cat memes.

        Fact:: Brad Pitt suffered an ironic injury on a film set In Troy, based
        on Homer’s Illiad, Pitt plays the brave (and buff) Greek hero Achilles.
        Legend has it that Achilles could not be defeated unless hit in his
        heel. (It’s where we get the term “Achilles’ heel,” meaning a vulnerable
        point.) While filming an epic battle scene, Pitt ironically hurt his
        Achilles tendon—an injury that set back the film’s production by two
        months.

        Fact:: Pregnancy tests date back to 1350 B.C.E. According to a document
        written on ancient papyrus, Egyptian women urinated on wheat and barley
        seeds to determine if they were pregnant or not, reports the Office of
        History in the National Institutes of Health. If wheat grew, it
        predicted a female baby. If barley grew, it predicted a male baby. The
        woman was not pregnant if nothing grew. Experimenting with this seed
        theory in 1963 proved it was accurate 70 percent of the time.

        Fact:: Martin Luther King Jr. got a C in public speaking The world
        remembers Dr. King as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement, and people
        often quote his “I Have a Dream” speech, which he delivered in 1963. Yet
        more than a decade before that legendary speech, while attending Crozer
        Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, he earned a C in public speaking
        during his first and second term. Check out these other ironic
        “failures” of hugely successful people.

        Fact:: Bees can make colored honey In France, there’s a biogas plant
        that manages waste from a Mars chocolate factory, where M&Ms are made.
        Beekeepers nearby noticed that their bees were making “unnatural shades
        of green and blue” honey. A spokesperson from the British Beekeepers’
        Association theorized that the bees eating the sugary M&M waste caused
        the colored honey.

        Fact:: Bananas glow blue under black lights To the everyday eye under
        normal conditions, ripe bananas appear yellow due to organic pigments
        called carotenoids. When bananas ripen, chlorophyll begins to break
        down. This pigment is the element that makes bananas glow, or fluoresce,
        under UV lights and appear blue. While this is definitely among the most
        interesting facts about bananas, we have another one that will make you
        want to eat a banana every day.

        Fact:: Wimbledon tennis balls are kept at 68 degrees Fahrenheit The
        temperature of a tennis ball affects how it bounces. At warmer
        temperatures, the gas molecules inside the ball expand, making the ball
        bounce higher. Lower temperatures cause the molecules to shrink and the
        ball to bounce lower. To make sure the best tennis balls are used,

        Fact:: Adult cats are lactose intolerant Like some humans, adult cats
        don’t have enough of the lactase enzyme to digest lactose from milk,
        causing them to vomit, have diarrhea, or get gassy. Cats only have
        enough of that enzyme when they’re born and during the early years of
        their lives.

        Fact:: Albert Einstein’s eyeballs are in New York City They were given
        to Henry Abrams and preserved in a safety deposit box. Abrams was
        Einstein’s eye doctor. He received the eyeballs from Thomas Harvey, the
        man who performed the autopsy on Einstein and illegally took the
        scientist’s brain for himself.

        Fact:: The Pope can’t be an organ donor Pope Benedict XVI was issued an
        organ donor card in 1970. Once he ascended to the papacy in 2005, the
        card was invalid, reports the Telegraph. According to the Vatican, the
        Pope’s entire body must be buried intact because his body belongs to the

        Fact:: A one-armed player scored the winning goal in the first World Cup
        Héctor Castro, who accidentally cut off his right forearm while using an

        first-ever World Cup in 1930. In the last game between Uruguay and
        Argentina, Castro scored the winning goal in the last minute of the
        game. The final score was 4–2, making Uruguay the first country to win
        the World Cup title.

        Fact:: The world’s oldest toy is a stick Think of how versatile a stick
        is. You can use it to play fetch with your dog, swing it as a bat, or
        use your imagination to turn it into a lightsaber. That’s why, in 2008,
        the National Toy Hall of Fame inducted the stick into its collection of
        amazing toys as, very possibly, the oldest toy ever. But wait—we aren’t

            from 9 to 12 twins per 1,000 deliveries. Currently that adds up to
            about 1.6 million twins born each year across the world—meaning one
            out of every 42 babies is a twin. Helping drive this is the
            increasing use of medically assisted reproduction, and the delay in

            A surprising side effect of pregnancy is that nails and hair grow

            Why do we get goosebumps? In this physiological reaction, small
            muscles attached to individual body hairs contract, which leads the
            hair to stand on end. We inherited this ability from our ancestors
            in part as a way for our (then) coat of body hair to capture air
            beneath it and in that way retain heat. But, as

            It might be hard to see with your naked eye, but everyone you pass
            by every day is literally glowing. The human body emits a small
            quantity of visible light ("visible" in the technical sense—the
            illumination is about 1,000 times less intense than levels of light
            that we would actually be able to see). Researchers in Japan used a

            emitting its lowest levels of light around 10 a.m. and highest at

            Copper and its alloys, such as brass, have long been popular
            materials for manufacturing door knobs. It turns out, this may not
            just because the metal's hue makes it look nice. In fact, the
            material has been found to kill bacteria. According to one study
            from the National College of Kathmandu in Nepal, "the metal ions
            denature protein of the target cells by binding to reactive groups
            resulting in their precipitation and inactivation. The high affinity
            of cellular proteins for the metallic ions results in the death of
            the cells due to cumulative effects of the ion within the cells." In

            were believed to be literally divine. The word pharaoh itself means
            "great house," as in the house of God. In fact,
            <strong>King Pepi II</strong>, who supposedly ruled for 90 years,
            thought so highly of himself that when he was bothered by insects,
            he would command that one of his slaves be covered in honey to lure
            the flies away from himself.

            The next time you see a can of Pringles, take a closer look—you
            won't see the word "chip" anywhere on the packaging. That's because
            Pringles aren't made of thinly-sliced potatoes, but instead
            dehydrated potato flakes pressed into their signature parabolic
            shape. That's what makes them less greasy. But when other potato
            chip manufacturers complained, the Food and Drug Administration

            officer left his post protecting the president to get a drink at the
            Star Saloon next door to the theatre. It was during this time that
            Booth entered the box seats where Lincoln was sitting and shot the

            If you listen very closely, hot water and cold water sound slightly
            different when being poured. The heat changes the thickness, or
            viscosity, of the water, which changes the pitch of the sound it
            makes when it's poured. What we feel as heat comes from the
            molecules of the water moving faster.

            In 16th and 17th century Europe, cannibalism was actually a fairly
            common practice, and it was all for medical purposes. The practice
            seems to have started because Egyptian mummies were thought to have
            magical curative properties—so they were ground up and put in many
            remedies.

            people when they went in the river. Wanting to help, the monk used
            his friend as bait to lure the beast into sight, at which point
            Columba commanded it to "go no further," and the creature stopped
            and swam back upstream. That river is now known in Scotland as the
            River Ness, which flows out from the famous Loch Ness.

            an adult), but the tastebuds not on the tongue will eventually
            vanish.

            <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte</strong> was once one of the most
            powerful men in Europe, but he suffered an ignominious defeat at the
            hands (or paws) of rabbits. After a military victory, Napoleon's
            chief of staff organized a rabbit hunt to celebrate.

            Saturn and Jupiter are gas giant planets that produce a truly unique
            form of weather. Recently, scientists discovered that there is
            plenty of carbon in these atmospheres. When carbon soot gets hit by
            lightning, it hardens into graphite and falls downward, where the
            pressure of the atmosphere hardens it further, until it becomes… a
            diamond! &nbsp;Storms on these planets may literally

            Australia originally had camels imported to be used for transporting
            heavy loads or for riding. They were let loose when their work was
            done, causing an unwanted spike in their population. Australians
            then sold the camels back to desert-based countries like Saudi
            Arabia, which use camels at a much higher volume.

            The country with the widest stretch of land, Russia, spans 11
            different time zones. France, though, technically has the most,
            clocking in at 12—but that's due to the fact that its territories
            are dispersed in various parts of the world. The U.S. ties with
            Russia in second, but not all time zones are inhabited.

            Because dogs are descendants of wolves whose instincts include

            constipation. By the end of the year, Barbieri was 180 pounds.

            serious health conditions.)

            During the flight, the pilots noticed a fault light, so one of them
            decided to check it out. In doing so, he accidentally released the
            emergency pin, watching in horror as the bomb dropped to the ground.
            The good news was, the critical part of the bomb needed to set it
            off was still on the plane, so it never exploded.

            carry around their necks. However, while one cat apparently made it
            to its destination in under five hours, the other felines took up to
            a day to complete their journeys. Due to the fact that the cats
            weren't particularly reliable and definitely weren't speedy, the
            service didn't last very long.

            You may have been told at some point in your life that you're either
            left-brained or right-brained. The story goes that "people who are
            left brain dominant are more quantitative, logical, and analytical,
            while right-brained individuals are more emotional, intuitive, and
            creative free spirits," writes

            However, this theory isn't true. "On the contrary, most behaviors
            and abilities require the right and left sides of the brain to work
            together to achieve a common objective," the website explains. So
            while you may have certain qualities and characteristics that define
            you who are, they have nothing to do with which side of your brain
            you use more. You can thank both sides of your noggin for
            contributing to your unique personality.

            in 2012. Using an electrical field to suspend a charged atom in a
            vacuum chamber, the team shot a laser beam at the atom and took a
            photo of the shadow it produced. While atoms have been photographed
            before, their shadows have not, making this accomplishment
            unprecedented.

            Canada to the north. But if you want to stay in the U.S., you'll

            The next time you eat something that flaunts the rich flavor of
            vanilla, you might want to be aware of—or do your best to ignore—the
            fact that castoreum, a goo that beavers excrete to mark their
            territory, is sometimes used to enhance the flavor of vanilla in
            food, according to

          <p>
            In 1859, the U.S. almost went to war with Canada because of a pig.
            Just a few years after the Oregon Treaty was signed to end a border
            dispute between America and Britain (which still ruled over the area
            that came to be known as Canada), things got a little heated on San
            Juan Island where citizens from both countries were located.

              ><i>Historic UK</i></a
            >
            explains that "a pig belonging to the British accidentally wandered
            onto the land of <strong>Lyman Cutlar</strong>, an American farmer.
            When Cutlar noticed the pig eating some of his potatoes he was
            incensed, and in a fit of rage shot and killed the pig."

            Despite efforts to resolve the situation between the two men, things
            spread into the rest of the community and got to the point where the
            governor of British Columbia sent three warships to the area. The
            two sides continued to increase their military force over the
            following month until British Navy Admiral
            <strong>Robert L. Baynes</strong> arrived and ended things by
            stating that he would not "involve two great nations in a war over a
            squabble about a pig."
