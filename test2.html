        Alcohol ‚Äì the coward's way of dealing with life 10 Things About
        Addiction 1. Addiction acts to decorate an empty life. 2. Addiction acts
        to avoid the pain necessary to take our proper rite of passage from
        child to adult, inside the tribal circle. 3. Addiction is how we avoid
        what we need to grow, evolve and become our best self. 4. Addiction
        invites losers into your life because you have no morals or standards.
        5. Addiction traps our traumas inside of us, in order that we live them
        out over and over again. We need to feel our pain for the traumas to
        dissolve and leave our system. Addiction blocks pain and therefore
        blocks our healing. 6. Addiction keeps us disconnected from whom we are
        and why we're here. 7. Addiction makes us dependent on others. Addiction
        steals the energy of others, energy that isn't the property of the
        addict to take. Addiction makes us a perpetual infant, bleeding the
        tribe of the energy it needs to prosper. 8. Addiction keeps us focused
        on things that don't matter today, that have never mattered and that
        will never matter in the future. 9. Addiction is the act of destroying
        oneself in an attempt to ease the pain of never loving oneself enough,
        to stop destroying oneself. 10. Addiction is about interfacing with the
        world as a child, too afraid and not confident enough to feel the pain
        of this world. Addiction traps us away from ever feeling the love in the
        world as well. Addiction blocks feeling and that includes all
        feelings.........even joy, love, excitement, satisfaction and personal
        growth. Not feeling is a coward's way of walking the earth. You've never
        felt real joy or real love if you're addicted. When you're addicted, you
        only feel fake feel-good chemical simulations...of real emotions You've
        got Money in the bank, a car, all your limbs, a roof over your head, get
        a few looks off chicks when you‚Äôre not a complete derro and you‚Äôre
        bitching? thinking you have it tough when in reality, you‚Äôre just a lazy
        cunt that‚Äôs had it to easy and now you have to work for what you want,
        you‚Äôre sulking? You‚Äôre fucking lucky you‚Äôre not doing 6-12 months at
        Silverwater and Mum and BJ haven‚Äôt kicked you out... It‚Äôs funny, you‚Äôve
        never had it tough and look at what‚Äôs happened? You got called out to
        man-up and cried for 3 months? Still crying How are the disabled people
        you see every day? You cannot be fucking serious You need to step up and
        fix your life instead of being a miserable alcoholic man-child Drinking
        all day in Coles Carpark or $8 drinks at the Timo, gay shit The reality
        of being a man Don‚Äôt let this happen when it‚Äôs too late ‚ÄúWhat's the
        easiest and best way to fix my life? <br /><br />Do the exact opposite
        of what I'm doing now‚Äù <br /><br />There're millions of cunts that have
        it 10 times worse than you Adrian not getting trashed every day... Stop
        living 1 day at a time Kelly Kinross, stop crying over a slut, get the
        fuck on with it, business before pleasure <br /><br />You‚Äôre the type of
        cunt now that 95% of women hate, you wonder why you‚Äôre single? weak
        derro mummy‚Äôs boy and you‚Äôre paying for it, every time you have even the
        smallest issue in your life you need to get trashed for days?... harden
        up cunt! <br /><br />You don‚Äôt want to get custody of Benji because that
        would cut into your drinking and socialising time so fate has chosen
        you... can you blame Kelly for wanting to move on? You know you want to
        as well, to many bad memories, she‚Äôs an untrustworthy crackhead whore...
        All you do is drink and fight, there‚Äôs no love at all, it‚Äôs disgusting,
        fucken toxic <br /><br />If nothing changes then nothing changes
        <br /><br />This is what you need to get through your thick head, you
        keep doing the same shit over and over, you keep getting the same shit
        results over and over, you keep hating those same shit results, but then
        you go and do the same shit again?? You're on the express train to
        Loserville with all the other scum and trash you know <br /><br />You
        keep living out this Groundhog Day cunt of a life you hate because
        changing would require some effort, pretty much taken the easy road your
        whole life besides the Tafe course you did... you‚Äôd have to face that
        reality can be a bitch but hiding from it makes things worse in the long
        run, you‚Äôll have to go into the unknown a bit, what you need to accept
        is you're going to suffer one way or another, just that one way is
        guaranteed to end bad and the other way is going to be decided on how
        much you can man up <br /><br />Choose your pain, sobriety with some
        loneliness and boredom and being responsible vs keep getting shitfaced
        and end up in hospital or jail and single for ever hanging with Boony
        and Link <br /><br />Age?? I think we‚Äôve established 1000 times you hate
        your life and the person you‚Äôve become... drinking, Timo, smoking,
        drugs, zero confidence, weak... sluts and losers aren‚Äôt going to fix
        it... 95% of people you know are either alcoholics or drug addicts
        <br /><br />Another thing, you probably want to start pulling your
        finger out and get back into the coding, if it all goes pair shaped and
        you don‚Äôt pull a chick, you‚Äôll at least want some money so you can
        afford one... them box packing cunts down Brooky don‚Äôt get shit
        <br /><br />You have to find a job, you have to tell yourself not to
        drink and smoke, you have become so weak physically and mentally, they
        both go hand in hand really <br /><br />
        <br /><br />STOP BEING A WEAK LOSER DERRO CUNT <br /><br />IT‚ÄôS NOT
        WORKING AND NEVER WILL <br /><br />
        <br /><br />This is the result of living 1 day at a time:
        <br /><br />$100/day on grog and smokes is $37,000 a year
        <br /><br />You need to look at the bigger picture instead of living 1
        day at a time, your instant gratification $100/day filthy habit is
        completely ruining your life, you‚Äôre throwing 37k/year away and for
        what? You're not even getting any pussy, making yourself soft and look
        old, you‚Äôre just deleting your life and you‚Äôre going to end up like
        little Tony, broke depressed addict man-child that no one gives a fuck
        about, just another washed-up derro... or worse, you‚Äôre going to meet a
        good chick, fuck it up because you‚Äôre a derro and haven‚Äôt fixed your
        life, then go through the whole process again <br /><br />You could have
        bought a brand new WRX, car like Trent‚Äôs or travelled the world with the
        money you‚Äôve pissed away in the last 2 years... you pissed it away
        because a slut cheated on you and you didn‚Äôt have the balls to go and
        meet someone else, so you sulked and drank and smoked all your money
        away... lately you just sit there at the Boaty when there‚Äôs chicks
        everywhere, haven‚Äôt even tried the last 5 times you‚Äôve been down there
        <br /><br />The best revenge is just to get on with it, meet a decent
        chick, get a job, get healthy, have some good stories, work on your
        weaknesses, she‚Äôll hate you for it, it will be fucking great üòä
        <br /><br />At the moment you‚Äôre just playing right into her lap,
        getting all fired up, emotional, nasty, needy, crying, shouting her
        drinks and smokes begging to get in the whore‚Äôs pants? It's fucken
        filthy Adrian, you‚Äôve turned into her, a needy brown tonging addict with
        zero standards <br /><br />Notice when you got really angry at that
        Poppy game, you started playing worse and worse, then you started
        thinking negative shit about Kelly, then you felt like a drink... think
        about it, you lose your cool and get upset WAY to easy, this is a
        massive weakness... you hardly even listen to what Benji says because
        your off with the fairies thinking about Kelly or negative rubbish
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You give Benji a hard time for giving up so easy
        <br /><br />He probably gets it from you <br /><br />You‚Äôre seeing your
        own weaknesses through Benji <br /><br />Set a good example instead of
        being a derro <br /><br />
        <br /><br />I suppose what you got to think is <br /><br />In General
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />One of your calls is ‚Äúget a real problem‚Äù, c‚Äômon man? A slut
        fucked around on you and you knew about it for ages, let‚Äôs be honest
        here, we both just used each other and now you‚Äôre acting heartbroken?
        You‚Äôre just pissed off at yourself because you haven‚Äôt manned up and
        you‚Äôre blaming her? Your real problem is your lack of self-control with
        alcohol and cigarettes <br /><br />Another call is ‚ÄúI'd kill for a piece
        of that ass‚Äù? Meaning you‚Äôd do anything? but then you do absolutely
        nothing, or even worse, you actually lower your chances being a grub,
        then complain you‚Äôre single?? <br /><br />Age, this is what is ruining
        your life... If you brought you‚Äôre A game when you met Lizzy, you might
        have pulled her or definitely increased your chances... you‚Äôre 46, you
        were late, no collared shirt, probably smelt of cigarettes, definitely
        smelt of alcohol, said nothing funny, unprepared as, smokers cough,
        brought up that paternity shit? That was the deal breaker for sure, you
        wouldn‚Äôt have said that if you only had a couple drinks? you massive
        fuckwit, huge red flag... you had a fucken shocker ‚Äì don't cry about it,
        don‚Äôt have 1000 drinks over it, you‚Äôve definitely proved that doesn‚Äôt
        work ‚Äì you need to fix the problem with a proper solution... this
        out-of-control drinking is ruining what you want most, now you want to
        drink even more because drinking caused you another problem, you need to
        get this through your head it makes things worse and will never end,
        never, until your dead or in jail <br /><br />Life is actually meant to
        be difficult at times, shit has to go wrong, we‚Äôre not in a movie
        princess, your main job in life is to deal with adversities and move on,
        that‚Äôs what separates the men from the boys... that‚Äôs what your problem
        is? no challenges, no goals, it‚Äôs like you're playing the first level of
        Mario Land over and over and over, you‚Äôre not pushing yourself and
        moving on, your stagnant... then when life randomly throws you level 2
        or 5, you shit the gear, fuck it up and get drunk crying for
        weeks/months wasting even more of your life... you‚Äôre just floating
        through life like Kelly but you don‚Äôt have a vagina? you can‚Äôt get away
        with it <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Honestly mate, even if you went back to Kelly‚Äôs today,
        fucked her and she told you she loved you, nothing would change, you
        would rot your life away with that junkie liar and her derro mother in
        Link housing while she was fucking around... she‚Äôs doing you a favor
        forcing you to man up, you should be happy because you‚Äôre going to have
        the shittest life with her <br /><br />You should be learning from these
        miserable addict cunts you know; they‚Äôre never going to have anything,
        be happy or get any pussy because they‚Äôre too weak and gutless to stay
        sober ‚Äì scared of reality and most of them don‚Äôt even have any issues
        <br /><br />It's plain as day mate? You want a good chick, but you‚Äôre an
        alcoholic bum with the mental toughness of a toddler, unemployed,
        smoking, no interests or hobbies, living in your mum's basement, Cole's
        car park and the Timo... .and you seriously can‚Äôt work out why your life
        is shit? <br /><br />You're eventually going to meet a good chick, and
        it will take her a few weeks to work out you‚Äôre a bum derro, like that
        story big Stuey told and you're going to be shattered, saying ‚ÄúI wish I
        pulled my sox up‚Äù blah blah like you‚Äôve been saying for fkn years... you
        talk shit like Kelly, lie after lie <br /><br />How good are some of the
        chicks you meet on Tinder? Don't you want one? Or do you want to hang
        out with Link and Boony killing yourself <br /><br />How disgusted with
        yourself were you that Thursday night being at the Timo? Everyone you
        saw was a derro fucking loser, that homeless guy? What a bunch of fkn
        low lives, you could go to Manly where chicks are, but no, you hang out
        with a bunch of old filthy washed-up maggots that never get pussy... and
        then you sulk about being single? <br /><br />Alcohol ‚Äì the coward's way
        of dealing with life, there‚Äôs a difference between enjoying drinks on a
        Saturday night and drinking in Coles car park on a Monday Morning
        <br /><br />Glass half-full mate, count your lucky stars you‚Äôre not a
        short fat balding cunt, looking like Monger or Dozza, stuck with some
        fat bird or some high maintenance cunt that doesn‚Äôt put out, you have a
        clean slate in a way <br /><br />Russ even has a shit job, but he has
        his own place and a new car because he isn‚Äôt an alcoholic ‚Äì you aren‚Äôt
        processing how expensive this habit is and how much of a man-child it
        has turned you into because your brain isn‚Äôt working properly...
        constantly sedated <br /><br />You're failing Benji on every level, it‚Äôs
        like karma has done this to you <br /><br />You're shooting yourself in
        the foot, you keep trying to fix the problem with the problem, which
        will make the problem last forever, it will be endless failed Tinder
        dates, no money in your account soon, skinny fat and depressed living in
        the past... you have to take the first steps and face the music, you
        need to do it tough for a while, hard road leads to the easy road
        <br /><br />All those miserable cunts on that fb page? All their stories
        are the same, alcohol has ruined my life, not one person has said I'm a
        heavy drinker and loving life, living the dream getting heaps of pussy ‚Äì
        it‚Äôs a no brainer <br /><br />You are pissing away a new car payment
        every week making yourself sick, broke and miserable ‚Äì you need to see
        what you‚Äôre doing to yourself for what it really is ‚Äì it's fucken sad
        Age, self-sabotage to the max <br /><br />Your scared to check your text
        messages? most guys would reply straight away to show how keen they are
        ‚Äì alcohol is turning you gay and scared <br /><br />Even Shano said you
        looked hung over from 10 mtrs away, he normally says you look good, I
        just thought he said that to everyone, he could see it <br /><br />You
        keep saying ‚Äúneed to keep busy‚Äù but don‚Äôt, need to cut down on grog and
        cigarettes‚Äù but don‚Äôt.... need need need but don‚Äôt don‚Äôt don‚Äôt
        <br /><br />You need to start pushing yourself instead of giving up like
        a toddler, get hard, make it through a hot day sober, don‚Äôt get drunk if
        some cunt pisses you off or something doesn‚Äôt work out... how are you
        going to get a job or a chick if you can‚Äôt even have a few days off the
        piss without crying <br /><br />If you're not getting stronger, you‚Äôre
        definitely getting weaker <br /><br />When most guys become single, they
        exercise, get fit, healthy, buy new clothes, get a job, upgrade their
        status getting ready for another chick, you‚Äôre going the weak addict
        derro who looks homeless approach... nice <br /><br />You need to start
        going through some stressful situations sober... every little problem
        you have, you run straight to the bottle shop or pub <br /><br />Alcohol
        is turning you into a gay cunt, you don‚Äôt even care about pussy when
        you're on it, you don‚Äôt care about anything when you‚Äôre on it ‚Äì happy to
        sit with derro‚Äôs at the Timo and cunts in Hornsby <br /><br />Be more
        like Russ because what you‚Äôre currently doing is killing yourself and
        getting no pussy over a fat abo slut you were only using for sex anyway,
        man up cunt, you‚Äôve wasted so much of your life on that loser, move on,
        stop being an alcoholic little bitch <br /><br />Don't be remembered as
        Age the little bitch, let's take a new approach with this problem - Age
        the man sounds a lot better ‚Äì think of that Arab cunt you barred on FB
        because he was a negative whiny bitch <br /><br />Jo Simpson rejected
        you for being a man-child, heaps of other chicks have as well, you
        should have been balls deep in that slut... don‚Äôt start crying, face it
        and fix it? <br /><br />Not working is turning you into an even softer
        derro cunt <br /><br />You havent even been able to look in the mirror
        lately your so ashamed of yourself, your confidence has never been great
        but at an all-time low now <br /><br />Unless your off your face, you
        feel and look like shit constantly, can‚Äôt even sleep properly, haven‚Äôt
        done a solid shit in months, car and room full of empties, stinking of
        cigarettes, then you write Kelly off when you‚Äôre just as bad... fucking
        disgusting <br /><br />Things are pretty bad when Jo Simpson and Link
        think you're a loser <br /><br />The combo of alcohol and smokes will
        destroy your nervous system... you‚Äôll be a shaking mess with no short
        memory in 10 years <br /><br />You can be pissed off, keep bitching and
        crying, keep throwing all your money away getting uglier, softer,
        weaker, older like the Timo losers you know, have another million drinks
        and it's not going to fix shit <br /><br />Do you think Russ drinks
        himself to death for days after he has a fight with Kharen? He‚Äôd be in
        the ground by now if he did, he knows it‚Äôs a complete waste of time and
        money, it‚Äôs not going to change anything <br /><br />You‚Äôre happier when
        you‚Äôre busy, not overthinking shit... get back into the coding, back
        into doing anything, you tell yourself you‚Äôre a boring cunt all the time
        and do nothing about it? your life is shit because you have done nothing
        to fix it, just bitching sulking and drinking <br /><br />Stop putting
        things off... Tomorrow never comes, do what you can today
        <br /><br />You‚Äôre not processing what you are doing to yourself? You
        are destroying your own life at your own hand over a grub
        <br /><br />Most of the time you drink, you feel worse and just regret
        it the next day, even at the time lately... another day of your life
        down the drain, another hunj gone, more disappointment, straight back to
        the bottle‚Äôo, it‚Äôs never ending, you‚Äôre letting the Manly town bike
        destroy you <br /><br />Got to stop the beta finger pointing man-child
        shit, got to stop being impatient and childish, you‚Äôre unhappy because
        of the decisions you make, you‚Äôre proud of yourself when you do it tough
        or the right thing, not the opposite... the decisions other people make
        are none of your business <br /><br />You‚Äôre not upgrading your status,
        buying new shit, creating new experiences in your life because your
        bumming, sub-consciously saving your money for grog and smokes, same as
        Mills, Holden‚Äôs, TBB ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty easy to spot an addict
        <br /><br />It‚Äôs annoying most of the time being drunk, you sit here
        unmotivated as, all emotional, the only thing to do is hang out with DY
        scum and chain smoke ciggies <br /><br />See how Craig knows heaps of
        cunts in Manly, if that was you it‚Äôd be fuck all if any, you massively
        underestimate how inportant networking is... That story about rapper
        Ryan getting rejected by his miss's multiple times but kept trying and
        finally got the honey pot, you never would have done that, and scratch
        your head wondering why you have no mates or pussy <br /><br />No one
        gives a fuck about your problems; a lot of cunts are glad you have
        them... they‚Äôre over a slut, people have their own problems, real
        problems even alcoholics think you‚Äôre a dead-beat dad <br /><br />Don‚Äôt
        be one of those cunts that stays with a pog their whole life they fucken
        hate just so they‚Äôre not single and get pussy ‚Äì gutless desperate
        co-dependant people pay the ultimate price <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Slut guts <br /><br />Kelly Holden is an untrustworthy
        alcoholic slut ‚Äì always will be, move on <br /><br />Kelly Holden hates
        you, no matter how nice she acts, never forget it ‚Äì she's nice when
        she‚Äôs using you... you‚Äôre always her second option <br /><br />Kelly
        Holden will never change... She will always be an addict slut
        <br /><br />Kelly Holden will ruin your life; you are the only one that
        can change this <br /><br />Kelly is teaching you a lesson for being an
        attached needy Beta, the longer you put up with her rubbish and drink
        with her, the longer you will live a life full of poverty, addiction and
        cheating <br /><br />You are actually turning into Kelly Holden
        <br /><br />The problem with seeing Kelly is it makes it too easy to be
        a derro who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck because you can be a full bum and still
        get laid <br /><br />You are getting what you deserve for staying with
        her for all these years, you knew she was anyone's years ago but hung
        around for the easy root and the fact she didn‚Äôt care you were a loser
        drunk with no game <br /><br />Same as Kharen, Kelly treats you like a
        piece of shit because you keep going back for more, too forgiving,
        you‚Äôre so desperate, you have no morals or standards and she full well
        knows and exploits this weakness <br /><br />You‚Äôve put sluts and
        drinking before your son because you‚Äôre a dead-beat <br /><br />You
        blame Kelly for your shit life when it‚Äôs really your own fault... you
        hate yourself because the alcohol has made you a boring needy depressed
        Beta and you're living a rubbish addict life, too gutless to stay sober
        and face your issues, you refuse to take the blame or fix it
        <br /><br />You‚Äôve been using Kelly as a slut for years and you‚Äôve hated
        her most of that time, but when she hooks up with another guy, you bring
        feelings and emotions into it? You're really just jealous you haven‚Äôt
        manned up <br /><br />Kelly could take half your cash, maybe more if she
        had half a brain <br /><br />You used to enjoy a challenge, really look
        after yourself during the week, now you‚Äôre like Kelly, couldn‚Äôt give a
        fuck, just living day to day destroying your body and mind over a slut,
        scared of reality junkie. You really are no different to a junkie with
        your current lifestyle <br /><br />Tait was right, you‚Äôll never get
        another job... while you're with Kelly <br /><br />Imagine Kelly went up
        there without Benji and you had had him since the start of lockdown?
        You'd be fuming then! you know Benji‚Äôs a big job <br /><br />You‚Äôve
        known her for 10+ years and you haven't wanted to marry the cunt or move
        out with her because she‚Äôs an untrustworthy addict piece of shit, just
        an easy fuck and nothing more, biggest loser you‚Äôve ever met, seriously,
        you don‚Äôt even like her, she‚Äôs anyone's, no future, get over it
        <br /><br />People you know are thinking why the fuck did you stay with
        her? What did you think was going to happen you stupid cunt?
        <br /><br />Every time you fight with her, you end up drinking heavy for
        weeks throwing away your money, health and chances to move on
        <br /><br />How many Tinder chicks have you barred going back to her?
        <br /><br />Kelly‚Äôs revealed a few chinks in your armour, you always had
        in the back of your head you were a bit of a stud because you were
        getting easy sex <br /><br />You were meant to use her and move on, like
        she did to you, but you got attached and lazy, you didn‚Äôt man up and
        were punished for it <br /><br />Don‚Äôt even entertain the thought of
        going back there, you have a very short memory when it comes to all the
        bs lies, anger, betrayal, derro lifestyle, Tait, the cunt has used you
        and shit on you for 10 years <br /><br />You still haven‚Äôt got it
        through your head... Kelly Holden is a fat abo slut, accept it, she‚Äôs a
        fucking dead shit and it‚Äôs better to tap out now than in 5 or 10-years,
        going down the Boaty when your 55? ha-ha, good luck with that
        <br /><br />Give Holden the flick... lack of any future or anything to
        look forward to, looking at Jack, Tait and her getting fatter, poorer
        and uglier is depressing <br /><br />
        <br /><br />‚ÄúYour success in life is largely dependent on how many
        uncomfortable situations you're willing to get yourself into and how you
        deal with <br /><br />adversity, rejection and failure.‚Äù <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Dead-beat dad <br /><br />The truth definitely hurts on
        occasions... something that just came to my attention recently
        (24/06/21), people have been saying (or thinking) I'm a dead-beat dad,
        sure I have alcohol and depression problems (all self-inflicted) but
        just the term is something that which has really hit home hard because
        it‚Äôs true and the truth hurts when it‚Äôs bad, Chadd Fox and that shit box
        Craig Holden come to mind, jail bird addicts still acting 15 in their
        40‚Äôs.... you must be fucking stupid if you think people see you down the
        Timo every day or hung-over down the road and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a
        full-blown alcoholic? <br /><br />More importantly, I'm being a lazy
        selfish grub, putting the bottle and the biggest losers in DY before my
        son, I made a long-term commitment having Benji and I'm failing on every
        level, I keep saying I'm going to pull my socks up, then I get upset or
        angry over some pointless Kelly shit and drink for 2 weeks straight in
        carparks or with complete derros crying over a slut and the drinking is
        doing nothing to fix the problem, just making it worse <br /><br />I
        turn into such a little bitch when Kelly and I aren‚Äôt getting along, I
        turn into a bitch when I don‚Äôt have a chick holding my hand, another
        Beta weakness, dependency and attachment, you need to start holding your
        head high like a real man... even when I'm round at her place I do
        nothing with him, he‚Äôs nearly 6 and can‚Äôt ride a bike, can‚Äôt swim,
        haven‚Äôt even used that rod I got him for Christmas, never finished the
        Lego I got him for his last birthday, didn‚Äôt buy all the shit on that
        list of stuff he needed for school at the start of the year, heaps of
        out of focus shit photos because you're too lazy to manage your proper
        camera, didn‚Äôt spend that money I saved on him that mum and BJ let me
        have for not getting them mother and father's day presents, full junkie
        maggot shit, more interested in drinking and fucking a slut, it just
        goes on and on <br /><br />I‚Äôm a bum and a dead-beat alcoholic dad,
        <br /><br />
        Jo made a fair call, <br /><br />I need to accept this then fix it asap
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You're letting yourself get outclassed by other guys so
        easily being a lazy cry baby bum alcoholic, then you scratch your head
        and think ‚Äòwhy aren't I getting any vagina?‚Äô <br /><br />
        <br /><br />More importantly, every time you get on the piss, you‚Äôre
        letting down this little guy on so many levels <br /><br />

        <br /><br />The psychology used in drug and alcohol treatment
        <br /><br /><br /><br />Spanian brings up some hard truths in this
        clip... he‚Äôs done 13 years, got off a $1500/day heroin habit ‚Äì now he‚Äôs
        healthy, misses, man's up, makes money <br /><br />Alcoholism is not a
        disease, it‚Äôs a choice... you‚Äôre DNA hasn‚Äôt changed, you haven‚Äôt caught
        anything, you‚Äôre not a victim, you‚Äôre a derro <br /><br />You don‚Äôt need
        rehab to learn there‚Äôs better things in life than drinking, do you need
        to be treated like a child or a 31er to work this out?
        <br /><br />You‚Äôre not going to stop drinking because you like something
        better, you need to hate yourself and your life to change, I do hate my
        life but refuse to face it... Only you can stop yourself from drinking
        <br /><br />Being an alcoholic makes you ugly, weak, broke and
        depressed, can‚Äôt pull good chicks... it causes depression and makes you
        a Beta, look at Link? <br /><br />Don‚Äôt you want a better life? Be more
        attractive? Stronger? Form better relationships? have a great girl?
        Money? Go on holidays? Own nice shit? <br /><br />Stop pretending you‚Äôre
        a victim or you‚Äôve done it tough... YOU have made the choice to become
        an alcoholic, you‚Äôre not being an adult, you're hiding from your
        problems, stop it or live with the consequences <br /><br />

        <br /><br />Fuck, I had just over 70K in my Flexi at the start of the
        year, 90K a year ago, now I have just over 50K as of end of July, this
        is the serious side effect of being an alcoholic man-child, I‚Äôm not even
        having a good time? I'm paying to make my life worse? If I was more like
        Russ, it would have been about 2-3K maybe... haven‚Äôt seen Kelly in
        months either so I can‚Äôt even blame that cunt, plus I haven‚Äôt been
        buying groceries, paying bills, haven't even been to the pub in months,
        do the maths cunt? You're drinking is getting worse, heaps fucken worse,
        your Flexi will be non-existent late 2022 at this rate <br /><br />
        <br /><br />28K pissed away in a year? <br /><br />That‚Äôs about
        $540/week out of your flexi <br /><br />Think of the sick pad you could
        have set up the money you spent on grog and durries? You could have had
        a place like Mill‚Äôs with top of the range shit, new bike, nice car,
        buffed etc. Where did that drinking/smoking get you? Kelly‚Äôs glad you‚Äôre
        a cry baby maggot, you‚Äôre staying on her level, level loser
        <br /><br />Currently you should be living off $45/day <br /><br />Use
        Mills as an example of how not to be, dress sense, shitty bed, she‚Äôs
        like this because she‚Äôs an alcoholic and doesn‚Äôt give a fuck if she
        looks like a grub as long as she‚Äôs drinking, this is what alcohol abuse
        does to people.... what woman is going to feel welcome here? they‚Äôll see
        you as Mills, old car, old mattress, you‚Äôre not buying new shit because
        you‚Äôre a lazy alcoholic who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything except
        getting on it <br /><br />It's funny when you see Mills, you think what
        a fucking loser, drinking in the morning, chain smoking, zero
        self-respect, hanging with the scum of Dee Why, smoking pot, fat,
        unhealthy, childish, addicted, shit bed, shit TV but always has a drink,
        pot and smokes, looks heaps older than what she should, carries on like
        a fucking retard repeating herself, exactly like Kelly, she‚Äôs a fucking
        scum, I somehow feel sorry for the loser but 95% of people would think
        she‚Äôs a straight up fucking maggot because SHE‚ÄôS made the choice to be
        like that <br /><br />Tash, Kylie etc didn‚Äôt give a fuck about your
        alcohol problem, no one does, they just fucked you off and moved on,
        you‚Äôve made the choice to be like that <br /><br />People don‚Äôt need
        another person's selfish addiction problems in their lives...

        <br /><br />10 Laws of Manhood <br /><br />Take control ‚Äî Manliness
        isn‚Äôt in your height or being ripped. It‚Äôs your ability to take action
        instead of waiting for other people to do it. <br /><br />Know the rules
        of exchange ‚Äî If you don‚Äôt receive back the respect and time you give to
        someone, walk the fuck away! <br /><br />Be financially smart ‚Äî Nothing
        is sexier than having money in the bank. Develop high-income skills,
        curb your spending, learn to invest. <br /><br />Have a strong posture ‚Äî
        Your posture can make or break your first impression. Forward head
        posture, hunchbacks can get you labelled as a nerd, nerds don‚Äôt get
        pussy <br /><br />Don‚Äôt be a people pleaser ‚Äî learn to say no, do what‚Äôs
        right in your mind, who gives a fuck if anyone thinks less of you, be
        selfish like everyone else <br /><br />Don't submit to peer pressure ‚Äî
        Don‚Äôt smoke, drink and party because others want you to. Make decisions
        based on what you like. <br /><br />Embrace solitude ‚Äî Don‚Äôt smoke,
        drink and party because you‚Äôre bored or lonely. You full well know how
        that works out <br /><br />Be confident with humility ‚Äî Weak men
        criticize others to feel good whereas true confidence lies in supporting
        others. <br /><br />Make eye-contact ‚Äî It‚Äôs repulsive when you don‚Äôt
        have the guts to look people in the eye. Keep eye-contact until they
        look away. <br /><br />Solve problems ‚Äî Problems are inevitable in life.
        Instead of freaking out like a chicken and getting drunk, stay calm and
        act rationally. <br /><br />Be bold ‚Äî Have the balls to say what you
        mean. Nobody likes your ‚Äòfake-nice‚Äô gestures. <br /><br />Don‚Äôt be needy
        ‚Äî You shouldn‚Äôt need that girl or group of friends. Have a life of your
        own. Goals you are committed to. <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Pamela is taking you down Brooky soon if you're not careful
        cunt, then you‚Äôll have something to cry and drink about
        <br /><br />Everything goes well in my life when I'm off the drink, I
        eat well, exercise, sleep well, don‚Äôt smoke, think about my future and
        what needs to be done, respect my money, do stuff with Benji, the list
        goes on... when I'm on the piss, all of the above stuff is the exact
        opposite, fuck up after fuck up <br /><br />You've been bitching and
        moaning for 20+ years on and off about all your fuck ups, all the chicks
        you‚Äôve lost, all the jobs you‚Äôve lost, all the money you've wasted, fuck
        up after fuck up you‚Äôve made because of alcohol and you‚Äôve done
        absolutely nothing to fix it? If anything, you‚Äôve gotten worse, you
        never used to morning drink or spend $100/day drinking alone chain
        smoking <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You only want to do something about it when you're getting
        no pussy, even worse now, you‚Äôre not doing anything at all
        <br /><br />If you don‚Äôt do something about it soon, you‚Äôll be working a
        factory job with Link drinking with Boony getting no pussy for the rest
        of your miserable life which will probably be short, sad and painful,
        batting off in your parent's basement collecting Centrelink, hating
        yourself even more for not changing when you could (perfect time is
        right now, low stress, no job, Covid, got cash in the bank), then you‚Äôll
        really have something to be miserable about <br /><br />It's funny, I
        couldn‚Äôt believe those bums Jen knew in DY and I was embarrassed to be
        associated with them, this is probably exactly how Russ saw me down the
        Timo when I was sitting at the table of derros and why he said ‚ÄòI never
        want to be a pub local‚Äô that was his polite way of saying ‚Äòif you hang
        with these losers long enough, you‚Äôll turn into one and never get any
        pussy‚Äô but to me it was completely normal, I was almost proud of myself,
        like that shit box Craig Holden when he‚Äôs hanging with all those drug
        addict jail birds who still think they‚Äôre 15 <br /><br />90% of your
        problems are alcohol related <br /><br />As Link said ‚ÄúAll of your
        problems are easy to fix‚Äù - and they really are, It‚Äôs the perfect time
        (late July 21) to sober up though, coronavirus lockdown, all pubs and
        clubs are closed, low stress not going into work I couldn‚Äôt ask for
        better conditions really, except to have a decent girl in my life but I
        suppose my choices have kind of ruined that concept and if I met one,
        I'd probably just fuck it up, I‚Äôm not ready, can‚Äôt even stay off the
        piss for 5 days during the week <br /><br />
        <br /><br />Imagine <br /><br />Imagine waking up next to one of those
        hot chicks you see down Manly? <br /><br />Imagine getting ahead in life
        and enjoying it sober? <br /><br />Imagine not being a slave to alcohol
        and cigarettes? <br /><br />Imagine getting healthy, looking good,
        saving money and going on holidays? <br /><br />Imagine looking forward
        to life instead of trying to constantly avoid reality?
        <br /><br />Imagine never having to associate with the dregs of the
        barrel ever again? <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />That should be more than enough motivation stop being a
        derro man child, get off the piss, get a job and you're act together
        before it's too late <br /><br />
        <br /><br />You‚Äôre the problem! <br /><br />I'm actually really starting
        to think I'm the problem, I just seem to stir people up when I'm on the
        piss... meeting Mills was a real eye opener; I got a view of how normal
        chicks see me <br /><br />I say stupid shit, get up on my high-horse and
        I‚Äôm lazy and selfish, sure Kelly‚Äôs a cunt, I‚Äôm the one who brought her
        into my life, I'm the one who followed my dick because I was Beta and
        too lazy and gutless to meet other people, Beta‚Äôs always stay with low
        standard chicks because they know they can‚Äôt do any better, like Ant and
        that Andrew derro, I was always going to pay the price for that which
        just happens to be right now in lockdown, I knew this 8 or 9 years ago I
        just put up with it for the easy sex... 2 minutes of doggy with a whore
        is not worth throwing your life away putting up with that lying trash
        bag slut, you have completely overrated that whore because you can‚Äôt
        handle being on your own and facing the fact you need to man up and find
        a new girl, because this would take effort and some balls, this has
        happened because you‚Äôre a lazy emotional alcoholic... she‚Äôs well past
        her heyday, you should have run for the hills when she got back on the
        piss, your life has been misery since December 2019, good times when we
        first met and when she got out of rehab but now, she‚Äôs just a fat using
        slut who hardly puts out <br /><br />Remember Steve the removalist? Kept
        going back to a whore and it ruined his life... Same shit exactly...
        little Tone as well, but who knows, both them guys are alcoholics, they
        could have been the problem <br /><br />
        <br /><br />I wouldn't worry too much about being unemployed and at your
        parent's place at the moment, they‚Äôre easy fixes... you should be
        focusing on your alcohol and cigarette addiction and your depression,
        you need to sort your general health out first before you shoot for the
        stars <br /><br />You‚Äôre guaranteed the shittiest life ever with your
        current drinking and smoking habits <br /><br />worst shit you could do
        right now is pull a hottie and have her leave you because you‚Äôre a bum
        alcoholic <br /><br />You've got to be careful hanging out with dogs,
        sluts, cunts, addicts and bums etc., humans adapt, eventually that human
        trash will become your normal and you‚Äôll become trash like Kelly and the
        like, seeing rubbish as normal <br /><br />You‚Äôre an unfit cunt Kinross,
        way too many durries, didn't even last 3 minutes of doggy with Mills, I
        was huffin and puffin like a fat guy who just walked up heaps of stairs
        <br /><br />One day, you are going to regret what are you are doing now
        so badly, you‚Äôll probably meet a nice girl, get a good job, then you‚Äôll
        have a stroke or some other organ malfunction because of the shit you‚Äôre
        doing now, drinking myself to death over a fat abo slut and where did it
        get me? Absolutely fucking nowhere‚Äù what did it fix? Nothing
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />What do women look for in a man? <br /><br />Honestly? what
        do you have to offer a woman your own age? You're 45 and camping in your
        parents' basement unemployed with addiction problems? What sort of
        chicks do you think you are going to pull out of that? You could get
        away with it when you were younger but now, you‚Äôre just going to rot
        like Chadd Fox and that Craig Holden shit box, those cunts even have
        their own places... You'll be fucking around with Kelly‚Äôs and Jennifer‚Äôs
        for ever, the money you waste on grog you could get a place like Jen‚Äôs
        easily, be able to cook and experience being a man for a measly extra
        $100/week <br /><br />The whole idea of being a man is to have
        confidence, balls, self-discipline, not be a cry baby addict looking for
        a quick fix <br /><br />Look what happened with Nicole and how I haven't
        contacted her for nearly 8 months because of my alcohol problem?
        probably got a Bobby Dazzler chick in her, that farm she had sounded
        awesome, not a slut maggot, probably loves a good shag and a good
        conversation and you‚Äôre hanging with Boony and Link at the Wanksville
        pub

        Fact:: The world‚Äôs oldest wooden wheel has been around for more than
        5,000 years It was found in 2002, approximately 12 miles south of
        Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and is now housed in the city‚Äôs
        museum. Radiocarbon dating was used to determine the wheel‚Äôs age, which
        is somewhere between 5,100 and 5,350 years old. Closer to home, these

        heard through a hydrophone (a microphone used underwater). These sounds
        even come from the egg before the turtle hatches. Researchers

        the kinetograph in 1892, Edison was able to record and watch moving
        images for the first time. He filmed short clips in his studio, some of
        which feature famous people like Annie Oakley and Buffalo Bill. But the
        real stars of these early videos are the Boxing Cats‚Äîadorable cats that
        he recorded in a boxing ring circa 1894. If you like cat videos, you‚Äôll
        also appreciate these cat memes.

        Fact:: Brad Pitt suffered an ironic injury on a film set In Troy, based
        on Homer‚Äôs Illiad, Pitt plays the brave (and buff) Greek hero Achilles.
        Legend has it that Achilles could not be defeated unless hit in his
        heel. (It‚Äôs where we get the term ‚ÄúAchilles‚Äô heel,‚Äù meaning a vulnerable
        point.) While filming an epic battle scene, Pitt ironically hurt his
        Achilles tendon‚Äîan injury that set back the film‚Äôs production by two
        months.

        Fact:: Pregnancy tests date back to 1350 B.C.E. According to a document
        written on ancient papyrus, Egyptian women urinated on wheat and barley
        seeds to determine if they were pregnant or not, reports the Office of
        History in the National Institutes of Health. If wheat grew, it
        predicted a female baby. If barley grew, it predicted a male baby. The
        woman was not pregnant if nothing grew. Experimenting with this seed
        theory in 1963 proved it was accurate 70 percent of the time.

        Fact:: Martin Luther King Jr. got a C in public speaking The world
        remembers Dr. King as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement, and people
        often quote his ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech, which he delivered in 1963. Yet
        more than a decade before that legendary speech, while attending Crozer
        Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, he earned a C in public speaking
        during his first and second term. Check out these other ironic
        ‚Äúfailures‚Äù of hugely successful people.

        Fact:: Bees can make colored honey In France, there‚Äôs a biogas plant
        that manages waste from a Mars chocolate factory, where M&Ms are made.
        Beekeepers nearby noticed that their bees were making ‚Äúunnatural shades
        of green and blue‚Äù honey. A spokesperson from the British Beekeepers‚Äô
        Association theorized that the bees eating the sugary M&M waste caused
        the colored honey.

        Fact:: Bananas glow blue under black lights To the everyday eye under
        normal conditions, ripe bananas appear yellow due to organic pigments
        called carotenoids. When bananas ripen, chlorophyll begins to break
        down. This pigment is the element that makes bananas glow, or fluoresce,
        under UV lights and appear blue. While this is definitely among the most
        interesting facts about bananas, we have another one that will make you
        want to eat a banana every day.

        Fact:: Wimbledon tennis balls are kept at 68 degrees Fahrenheit The
        temperature of a tennis ball affects how it bounces. At warmer
        temperatures, the gas molecules inside the ball expand, making the ball
        bounce higher. Lower temperatures cause the molecules to shrink and the
        ball to bounce lower. To make sure the best tennis balls are used,
        Wimbledon goes through more than 50,000 tennis balls each year.

        <br /><br />
        Fact:: Adult cats are lactose intolerant Like some humans, adult cats
        don‚Äôt have enough of the lactase enzyme to digest lactose from milk,
        causing them to vomit, have diarrhea, or get gassy. Cats only have
        enough of that enzyme when they‚Äôre born and during the early years of
        their lives.

        Fact:: Albert Einstein‚Äôs eyeballs are in New York City They were given
        to Henry Abrams and preserved in a safety deposit box. Abrams was
        Einstein‚Äôs eye doctor. He received the eyeballs from Thomas Harvey, the
        man who performed the autopsy on Einstein and illegally took the
        scientist‚Äôs brain for himself.

        Fact:: The Pope can‚Äôt be an organ donor Pope Benedict XVI was issued an
        organ donor card in 1970. Once he ascended to the papacy in 2005, the
        card was invalid, reports the Telegraph. According to the Vatican, the
        Pope‚Äôs entire body must be buried intact because his body belongs to the
        universal Catholic Church.

        Fact:: A one-armed player scored the winning goal in the first World Cup
        H√©ctor Castro, who accidentally cut off his right forearm while using an
        electric saw as a teenager, played on the Uruguay soccer team during the
        first-ever World Cup in 1930. In the last game between Uruguay and
        Argentina, Castro scored the winning goal in the last minute of the
        game. The final score was 4‚Äì2, making Uruguay the first country to win
        the World Cup title.

        Fact:: The world‚Äôs oldest toy is a stick Think of how versatile a stick
        is. You can use it to play fetch with your dog, swing it as a bat, or
        use your imagination to turn it into a lightsaber. That‚Äôs why, in 2008,
        the National Toy Hall of Fame inducted the stick into its collection of
        amazing toys as, very possibly, the oldest toy ever. But wait‚Äîwe aren‚Äôt

            about 1.6 million twins born each year across the world‚Äîmeaning one
            out of every 42 babies is a twin. Helping drive this is the
            increasing use of medically assisted reproduction, and the delay in

            A surprising side effect of pregnancy is that nails and hair grow
            faster than usual. This is due to changes in hormones as well as

            Feet are enormously complex parts of the body. Each foot contains 26
            bones, as well as 33 joints and 19 muscles, which work together to
            allow for a huge range of motion and movements. But many of these
            bones remain cartilage throughout a person's childhood, slowly
            ossifying into bone as the years go on. According to the

            Why do we get goosebumps? In this physiological reaction, small
            muscles attached to individual body hairs contract, which leads the
            hair to stand on end. We inherited this ability from our ancestors
            in part as a way for our (then) coat of body hair to capture air
            beneath it and in that way retain heat. But, as

            Copper and its alloys, such as brass, have long been popular
            materials for manufacturing door knobs. It turns out, this may not
            just because the metal's hue makes it look nice. In fact, the

            from the National College of Kathmandu in Nepal, "the metal ions
            denature protein of the target cells by binding to reactive groups
            resulting in their precipitation and inactivation. The high affinity
            of cellular proteins for the metallic ions results in the death of

            In 16th and 17th century Europe, cannibalism was actually a fairly
            common practice, and it was all for medical purposes. The practice
            seems to have started because Egyptian mummies were thought to have
            magical curative properties‚Äîso they were ground up and put in many
            remedies.

            Columba commanded it to "go no further," and the creature stopped
            and swam back upstream. That river is now known in Scotland as the
            River Ness, which flows out from the famous Loch Ness.

            Tornadoes can develop over water just as well as they can over land.
            When they do, they're called "waterspouts," and they suck up large

            water. If the waterspout travels on to the land and the winds

            pressure of the atmosphere hardens it further, until it becomes‚Ä¶ a

            This law put Connecticut Librarians in quite the pickle. The law
            actually arose as a legend and the people demanded the truth. For
            hours, librarians in the state scanned past archives of laws within
            the state until one librarian eventually found the truth in the
            <i>Hartford Courant.</i> The law was in fact an ordinance that was
            created in 1945 to thwart pickle packers
            <strong>Moses Dexler</strong> and <strong>Sidney Sparer</strong>.
            These two men were

            This area in the North Atlantic Sea is also called "The Devil's
            Triangle" because it is an area of the ocean that stretches between
            the tip of Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. It has been thought to
            seemingly swallow up ships and aircrafts. Explorers as far back as
            <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> have reported odd occurrences,
            like fireballs in the sky (that turned out to be a meteor crashing).

            Australia originally had camels imported to be used for transporting
            heavy loads or for riding. They were let loose when their work was
            done, causing an unwanted spike in their population. Australians
            then sold the camels back to desert-based countries like Saudi
            Arabia, which use camels at a much higher volume.

            Ever wonder why your little puppy obsesses over those squeaky toys?
            Because dogs are descendants of wolves whose instincts include

            <strong>William Stewart</strong>, to experiment. On a strict regimen
            of multivitamins and minerals, Barbieri got his nutrients without
            eating a scrap of food, which resulted in nearly two months of
            constipation. By the end of the year, Barbieri was 180 pounds.
            (Note: Fasting to this degree is not recommended, as it can lead to
            serious health conditions.)

            When it's an adult, the "Immortal Jellyfish," scientifically named
            <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em>, can transform its cells back to its
            childhood state. This usually happens when it is physically harmed,
            sick, or even when it is starving.

            During the flight, the pilots noticed a fault light, so one of them
            decided to check it out. In doing so, he accidentally released the
            emergency pin, watching in horror as the bomb dropped to the ground.
            The good news was, the critical part of the bomb needed to set it
            off was still on the plane, so it never exploded.

            carry around their necks. However, while one cat apparently made it
            to its destination in under five hours, the other felines took up to
            a day to complete their journeys. Due to the fact that the cats
            weren't particularly reliable and definitely weren't speedy, the
            service didn't last very long.

            You may have been told at some point in your life that you're either
            left-brained or right-brained. The story goes that "people who are
            left brain dominant are more quantitative, logical, and analytical,
            while right-brained individuals are more emotional, intuitive, and
            creative free spirits," writes

            However, this theory isn't true. "On the contrary, most behaviors
            and abilities require the right and left sides of the brain to work
            together to achieve a common objective," the website explains. So
            while you may have certain qualities and characteristics that define
            you who are, they have nothing to do with which side of your brain
            you use more. You can thank both sides of your noggin for
            contributing to your unique personality.

            It's pretty darn impressive that scientists have been able to
            harness energy from the sun, wind, and water, providing us with all
            kinds of alternative sources of power. And now they've managed to
            create energy from snowfall. According to a 2019 study in the

          <p>
            In 1859, the U.S. almost went to war with Canada because of a pig.
            Just a few years after the Oregon Treaty was signed to end a border
            dispute between America and Britain (which still ruled over the area
            that came to be known as Canada), things got a little heated on San
            Juan Island where citizens from both countries were located.

              ><i>Historic UK</i></a
            >
            explains that "a pig belonging to the British accidentally wandered
            onto the land of <strong>Lyman Cutlar</strong>, an American farmer.
            When Cutlar noticed the pig eating some of his potatoes he was
            incensed, and in a fit of rage shot and killed the pig."

            Despite efforts to resolve the situation between the two men, things
            spread into the rest of the community and got to the point where the
            governor of British Columbia sent three warships to the area. The
            two sides continued to increase their military force over the
            following month until British Navy Admiral
            <strong>Robert L. Baynes</strong> arrived and ended things by
            stating that he would not "involve two great nations in a war over a
            squabble about a pig."
