      How was that seeing Boonie and schmicko down at the time and tide last
      night? Used to happily sit with those guys when you saw them last night
      biggest losses in Australia, yes it's funny what alcohol does to people
      completely lowers their standards almost as 0 standards hanging out with
      the timer boys Louise carry that Rosie freak people with mental illness is
      litelink and you don't even processor properly because of the alcohol
      comma it's kind of like what Chris Stephen says call Sienna get some
      challenges in life expect? You just some slutt I just get everything
      handed to her because she has a vagina? You're a man mate somehow you
      turned into Kelly a bit over the years and your kind of expect the same
      lifestyle which just isn't going to happen and now it's more evident than
      other so you after now and the top thing on your list of Manning up is
      getting off the alcohol second on the list getting off the smokes not sure
      how it goes after that but I think there's going to be a job and some
      exercise I'm practising my social skills definitely being the top 5ish I
      suppose top 10 easy, another big one you have to work on is your
      networking and social skills always leave you in a better mood when you're
      sociable with people even strangers well most of the time Mills and
      exception but yeah I think this is going to be very important spring
      Harbour to talk to people mate people he's always been a huge weakness
      suppose the alcohol the lack of networking the smoking and hanging out
      with loses all kinds of goes hand-in-hand all under the same umbrella
      hoping it's just a ripple effect of the alcohol, when you sort Asian bird
      at Shelly and you said I'll kill 4 something like that how many times in
      the last 20 years have you said I would kill for something like that which
      means you would do anything for that but what happens you do nothing
      absolutely nothing now you're scratching your head thinking why the fuk am
      I in this position?, need to make a playlist of some positive songs you
      can listen to on bike rides gardening eccetera too much time thinking
      about that Holden s***, so that when you saw that chick that you see on
      bike rides with the funny hair and she looked at you you looked at her and
      said hi had a smile that's the s*** that puts a smile on your face not
      drinking Bulmers with Bernie and shamika that's fake smile that chick
      thing was real smile, taking it for a walk new bikes with no cable gears,
      distance 24.14 km
